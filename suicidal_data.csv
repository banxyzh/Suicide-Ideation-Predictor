1,health anxiety prompting some bad thoughts in my head i have been struggling for 2 months now with some health issues as a 26 year old male my pessimistic nature just makes me think about the worst my hands and feet are currently tingling and burning i just keep picturing myself on a wheelchair being a burden to my family girlfriend and so on suicide thoughts come to my mind as i prefer to put a sudden end to everything instead of deteriorating myself day after day losing motor and cognitive functions life is already hard as it is and now my health is failing for the first time 
1,everything is okay but nothing feels okay i ve always been a bit unhappy as a kid too i think although i can t remember much of my childhood i dont want to kill myself but sometimes that thought just comes creeping and it scares me a little a few weeks ago a problem came up it was a financial problem quite fixable but i just couldn t handle it i tied myself a noose and everything i was gonna do it i was all alone in the house with my dog so there was really no one that would be able to stop me i didnt do anything but i felt like i could have done it completely on impulse over a fixable problem leaving behind everything i love and my hopeful future i feel it now too creeping up on me everything should be fine but i cant help the feeling that i should just do it like everything would be easier for everyone if they would just realize how little they need me 
1,ptsd and alcohol i had some extremely horrible violent stuff happen to me a few years ago i was 21 nowi am26 i forgot about repressed it or whatever for several years something unrelated one day made me remember everything it all came flooding back into my mind and it was like i was reliving it all and felt like i was having a never ending panic attack for about 4 days this buried trauma explained a lot about why my alcohol pornography cigarette usages were all insanely high to the point they fucked up my life and relationships with people close to me in signifigant waysi amafraid to talk about what happened to anyone even people i trust like my family or a potential therapist due to extreme irrational paranoia about the people involved finding out and hurting me again and sometimesi amjust completely consumed by negative horrible thoughts and cant escape them i tried getting a sliding scale therapist a couple years ago and even t and gave up on the idea of therapy i dont know what to do i dont want to give up

1,i cant live in this world ok its too much its too bad and too evil and i cant handle it anymore theres so much more evil in the world than good almost everyone is just apathetic about all the suffering in the world or people actively contribute to it people harass hate and kill each other for no reason people get killed by natural disasters and most people dont give a shit at all they just think whatever better them than me and move on with their lives 
1,why is mankind afraid of death lately i am asking myself more often and often why do we fear death nowdays back in the middle ages for example of course you fear getting in hell and stupid shit like that but today even if it is completly painless why would you struggle to just end it all i myself am not suicidal i would say even if i think about it more than often to just quit go the pussy but easy way why should i struggle with life instead of going the easy route personally i think its because mankind fears the unkown we dont know whats after death because none really came back from actual death and reported about it like actual clinical dead but is is really the only reason like i know i am not going to kill myself yet and it probably stays that way because i am just too much of a pussy to be a pussy if you get what i mean 
1,after failing once this is how i feel i wish that suicide was funded by the government i wish guns for suicide would be like condoms given to teens so if they are going to do it they do it right i wish euthansia was legal i wish that i wouldnt have to fear buying poison or a gun off the black market because if i get caught my life would get worse 
1,my girlfriend left me i hate college i have no direction in life i just want to go to sleep and never wake up ive been thinking about suicide a lot recently and different methods the only reason i havent done it so far is because i am too much of a pussy i have access to enough drugs to overdose on i live near plenty of tall buildings i am seeing a therapist and psychiatrist all the pills they ve given me have only exacerbated my symptoms i dont care about leaving everything behind because i dont want to hurt the people around me but why should i go on living my shit life just so others arent inconvenienced one of these days i ll be drunk enough to finally pull the trigger figuratively literally

1,children of suicidal parents will you ever get over the news that one of your parents committed suicide i ve thought about it a number of times over the years but never gone through with it thinking it would be best when he got older but the more i read i see even those in their 20 s 30 s struggle with a parent s suicide now son is almost twenty but still think it s not the right time maybe leave a note for him to be told it was an accident caretc but i feel that would leave out a lot i would want to tell him via a note left from me to him at time of death i would certainly not so it at home and run the chance of him being the one to find mei was on antidepressants for a couple years discussed with doctor a couple months ago to get off of them due to side effects with erection and i noticed i would be crying more often so it is not a side effect of anti depressants that i am thinking of suicide

1,i don t even know i keep complaining about my life because i hate it and i don t want it at all but i m here and i just want there to be some way out some other way without hurting anyone
1,whats the alternative seriously i have chosen not to die so many times when i wanted to and it leads nowhere i am already in therapy i already take medication i was already hospitalized 3 times in the past year nothing makes any difference i was kicked out of my schools counseling for using it too long my new doctor blew me off for three weeks and now no one is willing to see me to refill my meds two of which are now completely gone but hey fuck it i wont need them when i am dead right 
1,every time i come off my meds and it makes me remember whati amlike without them i just lose so much hope i know coming off my meds is dangerous ive done it once before and had to be hospitalized i recently got pretty sick and wasnt able to stomach my meds soi ammostly off of them at the moment and i amjust miserable i know that its just a phase thatll pass wheni amback on but it gets so exhausting and frustrating to remember that at my core this is who i ami am not able to naturally be happy my brain doesnt work right and i always think that in survival of the fittest i never should have made it i think its amazing i have but i am so young 22 and i just hate the cyclical pattern of being okay for a while and then it all just collapsing again and againi amjust tired of it alli am not surei amactually suicidal right nowi amjust tired and hopeless i know i will be okay when i get back on my meds but at the same time i feel like i shouldnt have to take meds just to be able to feel normal like most people are its not fair and i know the world isnt fair but its just a lot i dont want to go through my whole life like this but i dont know that i have any other option 
1,so sick of being told not to kill myself no one will help help doesnt exist at least not for me if no one will helpi amsick of feeling like i have to reassure peoplei am not less than two weeks from ending it alli amsick of googling and being told to call the hotlinei amsick of being told to go to therapy i want to feel like someone gets it before i go i want the horrible truth not the patronizing liesedit honestly whati amsaddest about is not seeing the end of game of thrones or hearing the next panic at the disco album it isnt enough to continue but felt like sharing
1,only 15 and boy am i done with life i just cant take this anxiety i feel everyday school is tough teachers are unfair to me my grades are under average and the few friends i have bully me everyday by calling me mean things its not the words that hurt me cause i know that they actually dont mean it its the fact that they want hurt me that does all i feel is empty
1,i dream happy dreams about my death and wonder about how my mind works ive never been diagnosed with anything other than some panic attack issues years ago caused by some heavy insomnia that placed me in hospital after my heart went crazy after 6 days awake thats mostly better now though i sleep almost every night but i am just curious are these the kind of mindsets and emotions usually felt by those in depression ive spoken to people i know who have suffered or do suffer from depression and it doesnt seem to fit how they describe itsometimes i get waves of despair and hopelessness when this happens i literally cant even imagine a future not even tomorrow it scares me as my imagination is just taken away and i am trapped in the horrible moment unable to picture anything being better i mean this literally too as in my mind is totally unable to picture anything in the future at all other times i go numb theres no emotion 
1,i am ugly i am ugly and that makes me sad but at least i am tall can i just end this
1,goodbye world this is it i cant deal any longer with my pain i am tired i was blessed with nothing in my life i am lost and stopped eating i am finally at peace with my decision i know no one cares and thats ok it just makes it that much easier
1,theres no reason to suffer if consciousness survives after death its reasonable to assume it doesnt age or die and is endless if it doesnt then life is restricted to the few years we spend on this planet either way there is no point in continuing a human existence mine sucks so why shouldnt i end it
1,i dont really know where to start ever since i was 13 i ve wanted to kill myself i remember the first time i seriously contemplated taking my own life i just dont know why i hate my life so much because again so many people have been through so much more i am so grateful that i have these opportunities and i wish i could give it all to someone who has nothing because i am not worthy of what i have thanks for listenings
1,life got fucked up by family so i was unlucky enough to be born with parents that were jehovah witnesses i cannot understand how parents just assume that their kid will follow their religion and force them to live their life by gods word i m thinking about ending it all soon although it s not like anybody would miss me as i have no friends because those are banned too unless it s someone from our church
1,i want to die alone what i honestly want is to be diagnosed with terminal cancer but not tell anyone i want to just walk into the mountains and shoot myself somewhere secluded no horrific body to clean up if the animals take care of it right nobody will really notice i will just pass out of memory as it should be 
1,not sure what to do its getting harder and harder to get out of bed i am only happy when i m with someone anyone i guess i just wanted to see this all written out my willpower to resist the urge to end it all gets weaker as time goes on thanks for reading
1,probably going to delete this basically i have had thoughts relating to suicide for several months to a year now i went from being legitimately suicidal to being a teen with occasional suicidal thoughts i am not currently in danger but i wanted some help i frequently think of what would happen if i killed myself i think of the personal experience the pain the person that finds me the people that may or not care about me how it would affect family and friends does it make me go to hell etc is this something to be concerned about again this may be deleted to cover up my emotions
1,sitting alone crying a forest with a bunch of pills in my hand i am so close denial rejection and my bad life situation plus extreme depressions and a broken offended heart would have started therapy in 4 days but then i realized in most cases it doesnt help and if then it takes years i have no zero motivation left and i just cant take it anymore no one to talk to alone since 7 years not even a damn hug ive gotten from anyone becausei amunable to talk to people and to go outside anyway i did my best to make it that long there is no more hope i am over the edge all bad emotions at once i m crying at least 1 hour every night i am so done no one can help me and the only person i ever loved rejected me i hate myself its too much

1,work again or check in to the hospital as recommended i always ask for a permanent rest and no one can provide or afford that for me its not really of value for people to just rest all the time my soul is really broken and i am in more pain than is worthwhile so whats your plan for me after all the therapy and all the drugs at all the hospitalization its clear you have no plan other than to just send me back and hope i keep working put the onus on me to keep functioning and thats a plan failure
1,i ve tried everything else i just can not go on another day i ve decided that i can no longer deal with the hardship or struggle of life and have decided to end it today i see no other way out
1,can i talk to somebody please i ve asked my friends if i can call them for abit but nobody is responding i feel like i might just leap off today
1,how to reconnect with yourself this may not be the place but i m just coming off of a 5 day binge and nights with suicidal thoughts for you what are some recovery methods you ve done to bounce back if you even decide to do that again i don t know if this is the right place
1,i need someone i just need to vent everything has come crashing down and i need someone to talk to 
1,i ve been waiting for things to get better for years i am tired of waiting everything is the same all my problems are vicious cycles dont know how to break the loop looks like i ll just wait forever and die waiting things wont get betteri amjusting thinking about how much timei amwasting ending things now is a solution dont want to live 50 more years to be sure all of this is pointless dont want to be a bad friend anymore dont want to be a bad son anymore dont want to be a bad parent dont want to be a worthless human being 
1,my mind is telling me to kill myself please someone anyone be the voice of reason i am so scared
1,i realized my existence has no meaning the only thing i do is hurt people even by simply posting here none of this matters i am useless
1,i ve been teetertottering on the edge for the past few months which isnt saying much since i think about suicide a lot but lately i ve really wanted to go through with it i am just tired i am tired of being tired and life is sucking everything out of me and i cant stand it any longer i dont trust any government institutions like therapists ive taken so many different kinds of pills only to have them fuck me up worse than i already was or just not work at all i cant even talk to my therapist about the things that bother me because they never understand or i could go to prison if i did my health is shit it keeps getting worse and the shit doctors i keep going to tell me everything is fine i just need to lose weight even though i already have a eating disorder and lost 100 pounds and i am not even that fat and cant exercise very much due to my shitty health i am really thinking that maybe the best thing for me is to not exist anymore in order to end the damn near constant misery i feel i am already thinking about how to plan my death including figuring out where my cat will go funeral options exit plan etc i dont want to die tbh but dying seems a heck of a lot better than spending another 32 years hating my life and everything in it except my cat
1,how can i stop hating myself if all i do is keep hurting myself i ve been hating my self for 7 years and its been getting worse and worsei amthe biggest loser possible and i regret nearly everything i do ive moved house eight times over my life i can never keep a friend my social skills are terrible no matter how hard i try to improve them my eye contact is poor or too intense i dont understand body language and i have so little confidence that i stutter sometimes and merge my words together i avoid even looking at girls let alone talking to them because every time i do it makes me feel like shit ive tried antidepressants they make me feel absolutely nothing its horrible ive tried various self harm and i once stole from a boots pharmacy i was doing work experience for and overdosed alone worst night of my life ive been trying to be completely alone this past month so i stop doing stupid things i regret and trying to be more positive ive recently completely lost all my enthusiasm i havent told anyone this i feel that if i keep going on this route or if i start taking something then i will end up killing myself sorry if this heavy i just feel like i could do with someone to talk to you
1,somebody please stop me i was so close today i couldnt swallow the pills i was too weak pain doesnt end it will continue onto to others that care for you i heard this before and i believe that even though they dont say it many people care for you
1,even with therapy and medication i want to be dead so i dont have to suffer i am seeing a therapist i m on zoloft and xanax and i still want to die i have the means and access i think about it i think its going to be good for me that i dont have to feel this way anymore i cant logically think of a reason to stop myself because what people say youre supposed to do just doesnt seem like its working and if i tell my therapist or psychiatrist thati am in crisis i am going to have to go through all this again and i dont want to go through it anymore 
1,am i depressed or am i just looking for attention i definitely have anxiety and i think i have some kind of borderline disorder when i get this way all i do is lay down or talk about how i should kill myself i dont think id ever actually do it because my family loves me but ive noticed myself doing it just to make people notice is it all just made up in the back of my head to get peoples attention
1,dealing with too much right now feeling very depressed and anxious also nauseous and might have to vomit entire night again i dont think i ll ever be happy as much as my childhood days my head rewinds every bad thing happened in the past a lot if i had a painless and quick method i would be out already
1,why is there no limit don t call it the easy way out it s just it s not easy getting to that point it s not an easy decision to make it s not a deadline i have 0 issue setting i know what it will do to everyone i love and the people who love me even if there s not many that s not an easy thing to do to someone by any meansi see it as my to be selfish the i put myself first and i only see everyone trying to stop me againagain i m supposed to do what everyone else wants i m supposed to keep suffering to make everyone else feel like they are doing good i m supposed to fight because everyone else wants me to i m supposed to fight despite it being those same peoples fault to some degree that i m even here in the first placewhy is there no limit to how long you have to suffer just because it s in your head if i had cancer for the 50th time wanting to just end it all instead of treating it one more time everyone would be on my side
1,when suffering is too great i would like to start by saying that although brief i would need a million words to encompass the suffering i have endured in the past 3 years i am currently at a stage where i am thinking about committing suicide daily and frequently at that i have even tried desensitizing to various methods drowning etc by imagining them in depth the level of suffering has increased to a stage where i believe that i could overcome the thought of hurting people that i love because my suffering has greatly exceeded it as you are probably well aware the notion of a parent or grandparent enduring childs or family suicide is unbearable for them the grief it would cause my mother who has has an unbearable life of abusive husbands and skeletal disfigurement is great if i had access to a gun i would definitely would have killed myself the fear of drowning hanging or falling is greati want to die i want others to accept that i want to die i have been looking into possible euthanasia i am close to the endif you have read that all i thank you that is all i ask
1,i wish i was never born i ve never been good at anything and doubt i ever will be always living in the shadows of smart talented beautiful people who actually have a future sometimes i hate them most of the time i just hate myself out of everyone i knewi amthe biggest loser of them all everything is always about money and sex and its bullshit i am just some dirty poor how dare i have opinions hopes or aspirations i can never have independence and i feel like ive been set up to fail someone like me doesnt deserve to continue to take up resources better spent somewhere else i wish i could give my worthless life to someone who belongs i hope i find the courage to finally end my pathetic life
1,i am writing my suicide note right now i plan to kill myself soon i dont know what else to do for the last few years ive been struggling really hard plainly and simply i hate absolutely everything i am i ve lost all my energy and drive and i dont care about anything i used to i am just another failure that will fade into obscurity with time its better to off myself now than to keep burdening the world with my existence ive come to realize that some people in this world just arent cut out to play the game of life
1,losing hope i am 23 years old living with my mom and over 2k in debt from medical bills ive been healthy all my life until i was 22 when i was diagnosed with a fungal infection some call it a candida overgrowth and its been haunting me since january everyday has been a struggle with feeling tired and this brain fog 24 7 i am starting to get answers to cures but all the cures have potential of causing other serious health issues i dont enjoy activities like i used to and i am starting to lose my friends because it seems like i am pushing them away but in reality i just cant find the energy to hang out with them ive been having suicidal thoughts often for about 3 or 4 months now becausei am tired of the suffering on top of this i was raised by a sociopath and suffered a lot in my childhood and my biggest fear is becoming like my insane dad this brain fog ive been suffering from feels like its making me lose my mind and making me feel more open to putting a stop to my life
1,contemplating suicide contemplating suicide every night is not how i want to live dont know how to fix it i hate myself

1,will anyone give a shit if i just do it like i have nobody
1,i ve lost all my potential i ruined my own life freshman year of high school i was on track to being valedictorian i could have gone to an ivy league school i had such a bright future ahead of me of course i fucked all that up i went to ucr because it was the only good college that accepted me i had no idea that i could go to a cc and transfer to ucla i didnt even know that was an option my gpa sucks my social life is nonexistent this is the rest of my life now everyone has moved on without me i am a disappointment to my family and everyone i know this isnt the life i wanted its too late to be someone great to accomplish all of my goals i had so much potential i was a smart kid i dont want an ordinary life whats therapy going to do help me cope and make me settle i dont want to live this life anymore ive wanted to die for years lol i procrastinated on homework and suicide it looks like i dont know what i am waiting for i am never going to have the life i dreamed for myself i am such a nothing
1,anyone in a situation similar to mine 19 yo male in college struggling in school poor mental condition overall fully lonely not in physical state but in state of mind awful luck with the opposite sex nothing that genuinely makes you happy bleak outlook on the future i feel this state is pretty common among people my age in school is anyone like that on here
1,doing it to stop hurting others i have an anger issue and a carelessness issue usually i can keep both of them in check but theres been a perfect storm between events insider and outside work i keep escaping by having unrealistic violent fantasies about the people i run into i hate living in the city everyone is so fake and out for themselves i fear that one day i will lose control on another so maybe its just best to take care of myself first
1,lost and hopeless at what point does it make sense to kill yourself because you have exhausted every other option i ve had suicidal thoughts for about a decade now but i never really considered actually doing it until quite recently i am so far down the drain that i dont think its humanly possible to obtain the life i want a somewhat normal life anymore i cant help but feel that this is my final hope i cant keep doing this crap anymore i am either going to get better soon or i am going to die there will not be an in between anymore
1,before i die i need to tell my story this is my life its a long sad story but one i must tell to someone my life is forfeit theres no coming back from all this
1,i fucked up i accidentally sexually assaulted one of my very good friends i was in a terrible headspace and i went to go kiss her she resisted physically and verbally and eventually gave in the entire time i kept asking myself why i was doing this and kept apologizing to her but i kept going oh god i wish i didn t keep going i started kissing her neck and her thighs and pulled down her shirt i realized what i had done and left profusely apologizing she wants nothing to do with me now and i understand that but i can t grt rid of the guilt i feel like everyone hates me now with due reason and i ve been going back and forth through intense crying fits and wanting to kill myself i never have enough energy to carry it out but i amthoroughly convinced that it could happen by accident and i wouldn t stop it yesterday i was taking off my sweatshirt and it tugged on my neck constricting airflow very momentarily and something in my mind just told me to keep going i felt so at peace i m so scared of myself and what i have become every time i tell someone what i did in an attempt to figure out how to help myself i know they are judging me and distancing themselves from me becausei amabsolutely fucking horrendousi ve been going to class less and less and crying more and more and i dont know what to do with myselfi think suicide has been a long time coming i used to strangle myself with scarves when i was like 7 or 8 whenever i disappointed my parents because i felt like a disaster maybe i ll be at peace maybe she ll be at peace too she won t see me walking around anymore she ll be comfortable i want her to be comfortable i just want her to be fucking happy she deserves the whole world she deserves the sun the moon and the stars she doesn t deserve the pain i caused her so maybe if i don t exist anymore her pain will go away too
1,sorry in advance i am probably going to kill myself on my birthday i am 17 so i will be 18 if or really when i do it 
1,why should i get help if i dont want it i ve struggled with the idea of being alive and wanting to be alive for a while now i recently realized that i dont want help i just want to not be alive the only reason i would seek help is so that i dont hurt my loved ones ive attempted to kill myself before but i cant even begin to imagine what sort of pain and isolation that they would go through if i actually did it i dont want them to ever feel how ive felt but i just dont think that they understand how i feel even wheni am not feeling as depressed the thought of not being alive is so appealing ive always done only what others expect of me but ive never really wanted more for my life anyway ive tried therapy a few medications none of it has been right for me if they only knew how painful it is for me to be alive maybe they wouldnt be so insistent on me trying to get help i just cant wait for a medication or therapy to work that could take months or years every single day every hour every minute is so painful i just cant do it anymore
1,i dont see a point to anything anymore i am consumed by my loneliness and emotional pain although i know many others have had it worse i have bpd i realize its pathetic i cant focus on anything anymore nothing makes me happy i am 28 and have been like this since at least the age of 9 nothing gets betteri am really nearing the end because i cant do this anymore i dont have the capacity to connect with anyone no work i do has any meaning i cant gell the pieces of myself together i cant keep living like this anymore
1,i don t know about this anymore as i took my walk tonight i reflexed on my past i have been struggling with some depression recently so iv been stuck in my head i have found life hard to live with out purpose i m a 26m iv been in two serious relationships and i always seem to push them away with my insecurities all i wanted in life was a family but i feel it was not meant for me i can t take it any longer i unfortunately own a few guns and i spend most nights staring at them drinking until i pass out i feel it s only a matter of time till i man up and do something about it i m hundreds of miles from any friends or family and i m alone all i have is this sad music and my guns i just want to be loved wanted anyways bye
1,this is incredibly frustrating i am afraid of going to school tomorrow because i shaved and should i ditch school due to what happened between my parents or nah i have a lot in my mind i just dont know what to do anymore i am a shy anxious junior in high school with social anxiety 
1,i cant carry on every day everything becomes more and more difficult every night i lay in bed trying to get to sleep with every unhappy thought in my head all the thoughts are so disjointed unclear as if i cant think properly the only clear thing is that these thoughts are quite literally overwhelming every night i resolve to kill myself in the morning what is the point of living if all living is is a constant fight to have the will to live i might as well give up now
1,i want to so bad but i just cant bring myself to actually do it why do you want to die
1,i cant do it anymore i just lost the last person i care abouti amdone the pain is to much now

1,i dont want to write a note but i want to talk with somebody i dont want to go out all by myself i dont know maybe deep deep down i am lonely and i really do want help i dont know how to ask for help as long as i can remember ive been completely non verbal about my problems like i literally cant speak truthfully about it in real life because i was so afraid of it being used to hurt me in some way i feel very determined to die at this point and i have a plan that i ve practiced but i dont want to be alone when i decide to carry out my plan i know i cant write a note but i do want to talk to somebody its just too hard to say anything to somebody who can see me and act upon me or who has met me
1,is it really worth it guys i m really fucking unhappy i do take the effort to try and enjoy life but it is just not happening it s just strife after hardship after tribulation and i don t reeeeally see the return in all the effort put into it it s just the logical thing to do for me just kinda wanna play games that aren t out yet or experience new music those things are probably the only thing making me hesitate
1,its been really terrible i am 27 and have tried everything to fix my brain i have tried talk therapy self help books self help apps eating healthy exercise sunlight etc yet i never feel better and always feel a darkness around me that never goes away i am unattractive shy and have no friends and wasted my entire life i cannot accomplish anuthing all ive ever wanted to do was photography and went to school for art but i suck at it and now am stuck in retail everyone in life has moved on and i am thinking of just ending everything

1,after nearly giving in i ve made myself a promise last week i drove out to a local suspension bridge its in the middle of a park which is closed for the season and doesnt receive a lot of traffic the bridge itself stands 232 feet above the waters below which would be ample distance to reach terminal velocity allowing a quick and certain death as i looked down to the river below i thought about just how many people have been where i am how many of them could use just one person to just listen not judge or tell them how to fix their lives but just listen and allow for them to spill their guts and get that god awful pain out
1,my brain hurts and soul is sick my medications arent helping and my normal fleeting thoughts of suicide are becoming heavy i grabbed a rifle earlier and made sure i could use it with the barrel against my head please say something to me anything the anxiety is making my throat swell shut and my eyes keep welling up i feel like my prayers arent being heard and the thought of tomorrow disturbs me
1,i feel like the problem today is feeling real human connection i think the internet has made it impossible now your observations are very correct shut off the phone or computer go outside get some fresh air and meet some new people 
1,i really tried i tried everything i got a job started a study programme and i work out regularly and eat healthy i got over 80 of my anxiety and everything except of love is working out right now but i still feel pain i almost cannot handle and yes its physical pain like a broken leg just in my fucking head and its much worse than an injury i tried it all really i went to therapy medication everything i still relapse regularly i cannot do this i hope i have enough energy to buy a rope tomorrow i wont even write a suicide note cause i dont feel like iti am so fucked up
1,i am done i need help but i want to end it all so bad but i am too scared to fucking hang myself
1,22f currently failing at life i want to kill myself 
1,the sad part no matter what i post here i know i ll feel like a fool for it i mean nothing will change my life has always been this way and being a guy its not so easy to find someone to talk to about my feelings i just want a change in my life or i am ending it in a year from now
