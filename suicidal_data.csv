1,health anxiety prompting some bad thoughts in my head i have been struggling for 2 months now with some health issues as a 26 year old male my pessimistic nature just makes me think about the worst my hands and feet are currently tingling and burning i just keep picturing myself on a wheelchair being a burden to my family girlfriend and so on suicide thoughts come to my mind as i prefer to put a sudden end to everything instead of deteriorating myself day after day losing motor and cognitive functions life is already hard as it is and now my health is failing for the first time 
1,everything is okay but nothing feels okay i ve always been a bit unhappy as a kid too i think although i can t remember much of my childhood i dont want to kill myself but sometimes that thought just comes creeping and it scares me a little a few weeks ago a problem came up it was a financial problem quite fixable but i just couldn t handle it i tied myself a noose and everything i was gonna do it i was all alone in the house with my dog so there was really no one that would be able to stop me i didnt do anything but i felt like i could have done it completely on impulse over a fixable problem leaving behind everything i love and my hopeful future i feel it now too creeping up on me everything should be fine but i cant help the feeling that i should just do it like everything would be easier for everyone if they would just realize how little they need me 
1,ptsd and alcohol i had some extremely horrible violent stuff happen to me a few years ago i was 21 nowi am26 i forgot about repressed it or whatever for several years something unrelated one day made me remember everything it all came flooding back into my mind and it was like i was reliving it all and felt like i was having a never ending panic attack for about 4 days this buried trauma explained a lot about why my alcohol pornography cigarette usages were all insanely high to the point they fucked up my life and relationships with people close to me in signifigant waysi amafraid to talk about what happened to anyone even people i trust like my family or a potential therapist due to extreme irrational paranoia about the people involved finding out and hurting me again and sometimesi amjust completely consumed by negative horrible thoughts and cant escape them i tried getting a sliding scale therapist a couple years ago and even t and gave up on the idea of therapy i dont know what to do i dont want to give up

1,i cant live in this world ok its too much its too bad and too evil and i cant handle it anymore theres so much more evil in the world than good almost everyone is just apathetic about all the suffering in the world or people actively contribute to it people harass hate and kill each other for no reason people get killed by natural disasters and most people dont give a shit at all they just think whatever better them than me and move on with their lives 
1,why is mankind afraid of death lately i am asking myself more often and often why do we fear death nowdays back in the middle ages for example of course you fear getting in hell and stupid shit like that but today even if it is completly painless why would you struggle to just end it all i myself am not suicidal i would say even if i think about it more than often to just quit go the pussy but easy way why should i struggle with life instead of going the easy route personally i think its because mankind fears the unkown we dont know whats after death because none really came back from actual death and reported about it like actual clinical dead but is is really the only reason like i know i am not going to kill myself yet and it probably stays that way because i am just too much of a pussy to be a pussy if you get what i mean 
1,after failing once this is how i feel i wish that suicide was funded by the government i wish guns for suicide would be like condoms given to teens so if they are going to do it they do it right i wish euthansia was legal i wish that i wouldnt have to fear buying poison or a gun off the black market because if i get caught my life would get worse 
1,my girlfriend left me i hate college i have no direction in life i just want to go to sleep and never wake up ive been thinking about suicide a lot recently and different methods the only reason i havent done it so far is because i am too much of a pussy i have access to enough drugs to overdose on i live near plenty of tall buildings i am seeing a therapist and psychiatrist all the pills they ve given me have only exacerbated my symptoms i dont care about leaving everything behind because i dont want to hurt the people around me but why should i go on living my shit life just so others arent inconvenienced one of these days i ll be drunk enough to finally pull the trigger figuratively literally

1,children of suicidal parents will you ever get over the news that one of your parents committed suicide i ve thought about it a number of times over the years but never gone through with it thinking it would be best when he got older but the more i read i see even those in their 20 s 30 s struggle with a parent s suicide now son is almost twenty but still think it s not the right time maybe leave a note for him to be told it was an accident caretc but i feel that would leave out a lot i would want to tell him via a note left from me to him at time of death i would certainly not so it at home and run the chance of him being the one to find mei was on antidepressants for a couple years discussed with doctor a couple months ago to get off of them due to side effects with erection and i noticed i would be crying more often so it is not a side effect of anti depressants that i am thinking of suicide

1,i don t even know i keep complaining about my life because i hate it and i don t want it at all but i m here and i just want there to be some way out some other way without hurting anyone
1,whats the alternative seriously i have chosen not to die so many times when i wanted to and it leads nowhere i am already in therapy i already take medication i was already hospitalized 3 times in the past year nothing makes any difference i was kicked out of my schools counseling for using it too long my new doctor blew me off for three weeks and now no one is willing to see me to refill my meds two of which are now completely gone but hey fuck it i wont need them when i am dead right 
1,every time i come off my meds and it makes me remember whati amlike without them i just lose so much hope i know coming off my meds is dangerous ive done it once before and had to be hospitalized i recently got pretty sick and wasnt able to stomach my meds soi ammostly off of them at the moment and i amjust miserable i know that its just a phase thatll pass wheni amback on but it gets so exhausting and frustrating to remember that at my core this is who i ami am not able to naturally be happy my brain doesnt work right and i always think that in survival of the fittest i never should have made it i think its amazing i have but i am so young 22 and i just hate the cyclical pattern of being okay for a while and then it all just collapsing again and againi amjust tired of it alli am not surei amactually suicidal right nowi amjust tired and hopeless i know i will be okay when i get back on my meds but at the same time i feel like i shouldnt have to take meds just to be able to feel normal like most people are its not fair and i know the world isnt fair but its just a lot i dont want to go through my whole life like this but i dont know that i have any other option 
1,so sick of being told not to kill myself no one will help help doesnt exist at least not for me if no one will helpi amsick of feeling like i have to reassure peoplei am not less than two weeks from ending it alli amsick of googling and being told to call the hotlinei amsick of being told to go to therapy i want to feel like someone gets it before i go i want the horrible truth not the patronizing liesedit honestly whati amsaddest about is not seeing the end of game of thrones or hearing the next panic at the disco album it isnt enough to continue but felt like sharing
1,only 15 and boy am i done with life i just cant take this anxiety i feel everyday school is tough teachers are unfair to me my grades are under average and the few friends i have bully me everyday by calling me mean things its not the words that hurt me cause i know that they actually dont mean it its the fact that they want hurt me that does all i feel is empty
1,i dream happy dreams about my death and wonder about how my mind works ive never been diagnosed with anything other than some panic attack issues years ago caused by some heavy insomnia that placed me in hospital after my heart went crazy after 6 days awake thats mostly better now though i sleep almost every night but i am just curious are these the kind of mindsets and emotions usually felt by those in depression ive spoken to people i know who have suffered or do suffer from depression and it doesnt seem to fit how they describe itsometimes i get waves of despair and hopelessness when this happens i literally cant even imagine a future not even tomorrow it scares me as my imagination is just taken away and i am trapped in the horrible moment unable to picture anything being better i mean this literally too as in my mind is totally unable to picture anything in the future at all other times i go numb theres no emotion 
1,i am ugly i am ugly and that makes me sad but at least i am tall can i just end this
1,goodbye world this is it i cant deal any longer with my pain i am tired i was blessed with nothing in my life i am lost and stopped eating i am finally at peace with my decision i know no one cares and thats ok it just makes it that much easier
1,theres no reason to suffer if consciousness survives after death its reasonable to assume it doesnt age or die and is endless if it doesnt then life is restricted to the few years we spend on this planet either way there is no point in continuing a human existence mine sucks so why shouldnt i end it
1,i dont really know where to start ever since i was 13 i ve wanted to kill myself i remember the first time i seriously contemplated taking my own life i just dont know why i hate my life so much because again so many people have been through so much more i am so grateful that i have these opportunities and i wish i could give it all to someone who has nothing because i am not worthy of what i have thanks for listenings
1,life got fucked up by family so i was unlucky enough to be born with parents that were jehovah witnesses i cannot understand how parents just assume that their kid will follow their religion and force them to live their life by gods word i m thinking about ending it all soon although it s not like anybody would miss me as i have no friends because those are banned too unless it s someone from our church
1,i want to die alone what i honestly want is to be diagnosed with terminal cancer but not tell anyone i want to just walk into the mountains and shoot myself somewhere secluded no horrific body to clean up if the animals take care of it right nobody will really notice i will just pass out of memory as it should be 
1,not sure what to do its getting harder and harder to get out of bed i am only happy when i m with someone anyone i guess i just wanted to see this all written out my willpower to resist the urge to end it all gets weaker as time goes on thanks for reading
1,probably going to delete this basically i have had thoughts relating to suicide for several months to a year now i went from being legitimately suicidal to being a teen with occasional suicidal thoughts i am not currently in danger but i wanted some help i frequently think of what would happen if i killed myself i think of the personal experience the pain the person that finds me the people that may or not care about me how it would affect family and friends does it make me go to hell etc is this something to be concerned about again this may be deleted to cover up my emotions
1,sitting alone crying a forest with a bunch of pills in my hand i am so close denial rejection and my bad life situation plus extreme depressions and a broken offended heart would have started therapy in 4 days but then i realized in most cases it doesnt help and if then it takes years i have no zero motivation left and i just cant take it anymore no one to talk to alone since 7 years not even a damn hug ive gotten from anyone becausei amunable to talk to people and to go outside anyway i did my best to make it that long there is no more hope i am over the edge all bad emotions at once i m crying at least 1 hour every night i am so done no one can help me and the only person i ever loved rejected me i hate myself its too much

1,work again or check in to the hospital as recommended i always ask for a permanent rest and no one can provide or afford that for me its not really of value for people to just rest all the time my soul is really broken and i am in more pain than is worthwhile so whats your plan for me after all the therapy and all the drugs at all the hospitalization its clear you have no plan other than to just send me back and hope i keep working put the onus on me to keep functioning and thats a plan failure
1,i ve tried everything else i just can not go on another day i ve decided that i can no longer deal with the hardship or struggle of life and have decided to end it today i see no other way out
1,can i talk to somebody please i ve asked my friends if i can call them for abit but nobody is responding i feel like i might just leap off today
1,how to reconnect with yourself this may not be the place but i m just coming off of a 5 day binge and nights with suicidal thoughts for you what are some recovery methods you ve done to bounce back if you even decide to do that again i don t know if this is the right place
1,i need someone i just need to vent everything has come crashing down and i need someone to talk to 
1,i ve been waiting for things to get better for years i am tired of waiting everything is the same all my problems are vicious cycles dont know how to break the loop looks like i ll just wait forever and die waiting things wont get betteri amjusting thinking about how much timei amwasting ending things now is a solution dont want to live 50 more years to be sure all of this is pointless dont want to be a bad friend anymore dont want to be a bad son anymore dont want to be a bad parent dont want to be a worthless human being 
1,my mind is telling me to kill myself please someone anyone be the voice of reason i am so scared
1,i realized my existence has no meaning the only thing i do is hurt people even by simply posting here none of this matters i am useless
1,i ve been teetertottering on the edge for the past few months which isnt saying much since i think about suicide a lot but lately i ve really wanted to go through with it i am just tired i am tired of being tired and life is sucking everything out of me and i cant stand it any longer i dont trust any government institutions like therapists ive taken so many different kinds of pills only to have them fuck me up worse than i already was or just not work at all i cant even talk to my therapist about the things that bother me because they never understand or i could go to prison if i did my health is shit it keeps getting worse and the shit doctors i keep going to tell me everything is fine i just need to lose weight even though i already have a eating disorder and lost 100 pounds and i am not even that fat and cant exercise very much due to my shitty health i am really thinking that maybe the best thing for me is to not exist anymore in order to end the damn near constant misery i feel i am already thinking about how to plan my death including figuring out where my cat will go funeral options exit plan etc i dont want to die tbh but dying seems a heck of a lot better than spending another 32 years hating my life and everything in it except my cat
1,how can i stop hating myself if all i do is keep hurting myself i ve been hating my self for 7 years and its been getting worse and worsei amthe biggest loser possible and i regret nearly everything i do ive moved house eight times over my life i can never keep a friend my social skills are terrible no matter how hard i try to improve them my eye contact is poor or too intense i dont understand body language and i have so little confidence that i stutter sometimes and merge my words together i avoid even looking at girls let alone talking to them because every time i do it makes me feel like shit ive tried antidepressants they make me feel absolutely nothing its horrible ive tried various self harm and i once stole from a boots pharmacy i was doing work experience for and overdosed alone worst night of my life ive been trying to be completely alone this past month so i stop doing stupid things i regret and trying to be more positive ive recently completely lost all my enthusiasm i havent told anyone this i feel that if i keep going on this route or if i start taking something then i will end up killing myself sorry if this heavy i just feel like i could do with someone to talk to you
1,somebody please stop me i was so close today i couldnt swallow the pills i was too weak pain doesnt end it will continue onto to others that care for you i heard this before and i believe that even though they dont say it many people care for you
1,even with therapy and medication i want to be dead so i dont have to suffer i am seeing a therapist i m on zoloft and xanax and i still want to die i have the means and access i think about it i think its going to be good for me that i dont have to feel this way anymore i cant logically think of a reason to stop myself because what people say youre supposed to do just doesnt seem like its working and if i tell my therapist or psychiatrist thati am in crisis i am going to have to go through all this again and i dont want to go through it anymore 
1,am i depressed or am i just looking for attention i definitely have anxiety and i think i have some kind of borderline disorder when i get this way all i do is lay down or talk about how i should kill myself i dont think id ever actually do it because my family loves me but ive noticed myself doing it just to make people notice is it all just made up in the back of my head to get peoples attention
1,dealing with too much right now feeling very depressed and anxious also nauseous and might have to vomit entire night again i dont think i ll ever be happy as much as my childhood days my head rewinds every bad thing happened in the past a lot if i had a painless and quick method i would be out already
1,why is there no limit don t call it the easy way out it s just it s not easy getting to that point it s not an easy decision to make it s not a deadline i have 0 issue setting i know what it will do to everyone i love and the people who love me even if there s not many that s not an easy thing to do to someone by any meansi see it as my to be selfish the i put myself first and i only see everyone trying to stop me againagain i m supposed to do what everyone else wants i m supposed to keep suffering to make everyone else feel like they are doing good i m supposed to fight because everyone else wants me to i m supposed to fight despite it being those same peoples fault to some degree that i m even here in the first placewhy is there no limit to how long you have to suffer just because it s in your head if i had cancer for the 50th time wanting to just end it all instead of treating it one more time everyone would be on my side
1,when suffering is too great i would like to start by saying that although brief i would need a million words to encompass the suffering i have endured in the past 3 years i am currently at a stage where i am thinking about committing suicide daily and frequently at that i have even tried desensitizing to various methods drowning etc by imagining them in depth the level of suffering has increased to a stage where i believe that i could overcome the thought of hurting people that i love because my suffering has greatly exceeded it as you are probably well aware the notion of a parent or grandparent enduring childs or family suicide is unbearable for them the grief it would cause my mother who has has an unbearable life of abusive husbands and skeletal disfigurement is great if i had access to a gun i would definitely would have killed myself the fear of drowning hanging or falling is greati want to die i want others to accept that i want to die i have been looking into possible euthanasia i am close to the endif you have read that all i thank you that is all i ask
1,i wish i was never born i ve never been good at anything and doubt i ever will be always living in the shadows of smart talented beautiful people who actually have a future sometimes i hate them most of the time i just hate myself out of everyone i knewi amthe biggest loser of them all everything is always about money and sex and its bullshit i am just some dirty poor how dare i have opinions hopes or aspirations i can never have independence and i feel like ive been set up to fail someone like me doesnt deserve to continue to take up resources better spent somewhere else i wish i could give my worthless life to someone who belongs i hope i find the courage to finally end my pathetic life
1,i am writing my suicide note right now i plan to kill myself soon i dont know what else to do for the last few years ive been struggling really hard plainly and simply i hate absolutely everything i am i ve lost all my energy and drive and i dont care about anything i used to i am just another failure that will fade into obscurity with time its better to off myself now than to keep burdening the world with my existence ive come to realize that some people in this world just arent cut out to play the game of life
1,losing hope i am 23 years old living with my mom and over 2k in debt from medical bills ive been healthy all my life until i was 22 when i was diagnosed with a fungal infection some call it a candida overgrowth and its been haunting me since january everyday has been a struggle with feeling tired and this brain fog 24 7 i am starting to get answers to cures but all the cures have potential of causing other serious health issues i dont enjoy activities like i used to and i am starting to lose my friends because it seems like i am pushing them away but in reality i just cant find the energy to hang out with them ive been having suicidal thoughts often for about 3 or 4 months now becausei am tired of the suffering on top of this i was raised by a sociopath and suffered a lot in my childhood and my biggest fear is becoming like my insane dad this brain fog ive been suffering from feels like its making me lose my mind and making me feel more open to putting a stop to my life

1,will anyone give a shit if i just do it like i have nobody
1,i ve lost all my potential i ruined my own life freshman year of high school i was on track to being valedictorian i could have gone to an ivy league school i had such a bright future ahead of me of course i fucked all that up i went to ucr because it was the only good college that accepted me i had no idea that i could go to a cc and transfer to ucla i didnt even know that was an option my gpa sucks my social life is nonexistent this is the rest of my life now everyone has moved on without me i am a disappointment to my family and everyone i know this isnt the life i wanted its too late to be someone great to accomplish all of my goals i had so much potential i was a smart kid i dont want an ordinary life whats therapy going to do help me cope and make me settle i dont want to live this life anymore ive wanted to die for years lol i procrastinated on homework and suicide it looks like i dont know what i am waiting for i am never going to have the life i dreamed for myself i am such a nothing
1,anyone in a situation similar to mine 19 yo male in college struggling in school poor mental condition overall fully lonely not in physical state but in state of mind awful luck with the opposite sex nothing that genuinely makes you happy bleak outlook on the future i feel this state is pretty common among people my age in school is anyone like that on here
1,doing it to stop hurting others i have an anger issue and a carelessness issue usually i can keep both of them in check but theres been a perfect storm between events insider and outside work i keep escaping by having unrealistic violent fantasies about the people i run into i hate living in the city everyone is so fake and out for themselves i fear that one day i will lose control on another so maybe its just best to take care of myself first
1,lost and hopeless at what point does it make sense to kill yourself because you have exhausted every other option i ve had suicidal thoughts for about a decade now but i never really considered actually doing it until quite recently i am so far down the drain that i dont think its humanly possible to obtain the life i want a somewhat normal life anymore i cant help but feel that this is my final hope i cant keep doing this crap anymore i am either going to get better soon or i am going to die there will not be an in between anymore
1,before i die i need to tell my story this is my life its a long sad story but one i must tell to someone my life is forfeit theres no coming back from all this
1,i fucked up i accidentally sexually assaulted one of my very good friends i was in a terrible headspace and i went to go kiss her she resisted physically and verbally and eventually gave in the entire time i kept asking myself why i was doing this and kept apologizing to her but i kept going oh god i wish i didn t keep going i started kissing her neck and her thighs and pulled down her shirt i realized what i had done and left profusely apologizing she wants nothing to do with me now and i understand that but i can t grt rid of the guilt i feel like everyone hates me now with due reason and i ve been going back and forth through intense crying fits and wanting to kill myself i never have enough energy to carry it out but i amthoroughly convinced that it could happen by accident and i wouldn t stop it yesterday i was taking off my sweatshirt and it tugged on my neck constricting airflow very momentarily and something in my mind just told me to keep going i felt so at peace i m so scared of myself and what i have become every time i tell someone what i did in an attempt to figure out how to help myself i know they are judging me and distancing themselves from me becausei amabsolutely fucking horrendousi ve been going to class less and less and crying more and more and i dont know what to do with myselfi think suicide has been a long time coming i used to strangle myself with scarves when i was like 7 or 8 whenever i disappointed my parents because i felt like a disaster maybe i ll be at peace maybe she ll be at peace too she won t see me walking around anymore she ll be comfortable i want her to be comfortable i just want her to be fucking happy she deserves the whole world she deserves the sun the moon and the stars she doesn t deserve the pain i caused her so maybe if i don t exist anymore her pain will go away too
1,sorry in advance i am probably going to kill myself on my birthday i am 17 so i will be 18 if or really when i do it 
1,why should i get help if i dont want it i ve struggled with the idea of being alive and wanting to be alive for a while now i recently realized that i dont want help i just want to not be alive the only reason i would seek help is so that i dont hurt my loved ones ive attempted to kill myself before but i cant even begin to imagine what sort of pain and isolation that they would go through if i actually did it i dont want them to ever feel how ive felt but i just dont think that they understand how i feel even wheni am not feeling as depressed the thought of not being alive is so appealing ive always done only what others expect of me but ive never really wanted more for my life anyway ive tried therapy a few medications none of it has been right for me if they only knew how painful it is for me to be alive maybe they wouldnt be so insistent on me trying to get help i just cant wait for a medication or therapy to work that could take months or years every single day every hour every minute is so painful i just cant do it anymore
1,i dont see a point to anything anymore i am consumed by my loneliness and emotional pain although i know many others have had it worse i have bpd i realize its pathetic i cant focus on anything anymore nothing makes me happy i am 28 and have been like this since at least the age of 9 nothing gets betteri am really nearing the end because i cant do this anymore i dont have the capacity to connect with anyone no work i do has any meaning i cant gell the pieces of myself together i cant keep living like this anymore
1,i don t know about this anymore as i took my walk tonight i reflexed on my past i have been struggling with some depression recently so iv been stuck in my head i have found life hard to live with out purpose i m a 26m iv been in two serious relationships and i always seem to push them away with my insecurities all i wanted in life was a family but i feel it was not meant for me i can t take it any longer i unfortunately own a few guns and i spend most nights staring at them drinking until i pass out i feel it s only a matter of time till i man up and do something about it i m hundreds of miles from any friends or family and i m alone all i have is this sad music and my guns i just want to be loved wanted anyways bye
1,this is incredibly frustrating i am afraid of going to school tomorrow because i shaved and should i ditch school due to what happened between my parents or nah i have a lot in my mind i just dont know what to do anymore i am a shy anxious junior in high school with social anxiety 
1,i cant carry on every day everything becomes more and more difficult every night i lay in bed trying to get to sleep with every unhappy thought in my head all the thoughts are so disjointed unclear as if i cant think properly the only clear thing is that these thoughts are quite literally overwhelming every night i resolve to kill myself in the morning what is the point of living if all living is is a constant fight to have the will to live i might as well give up now
1,i want to so bad but i just cant bring myself to actually do it why do you want to die

1,is it really worth it guys i m really fucking unhappy i do take the effort to try and enjoy life but it is just not happening it s just strife after hardship after tribulation and i don t reeeeally see the return in all the effort put into it it s just the logical thing to do for me just kinda wanna play games that aren t out yet or experience new music those things are probably the only thing making me hesitate

1,after nearly giving in i ve made myself a promise last week i drove out to a local suspension bridge its in the middle of a park which is closed for the season and doesnt receive a lot of traffic the bridge itself stands 232 feet above the waters below which would be ample distance to reach terminal velocity allowing a quick and certain death as i looked down to the river below i thought about just how many people have been where i am how many of them could use just one person to just listen not judge or tell them how to fix their lives but just listen and allow for them to spill their guts and get that god awful pain out
1,my brain hurts and soul is sick my medications arent helping and my normal fleeting thoughts of suicide are becoming heavy i grabbed a rifle earlier and made sure i could use it with the barrel against my head please say something to me anything the anxiety is making my throat swell shut and my eyes keep welling up i feel like my prayers arent being heard and the thought of tomorrow disturbs me
1,i feel like the problem today is feeling real human connection i think the internet has made it impossible now your observations are very correct shut off the phone or computer go outside get some fresh air and meet some new people 
1,i really tried i tried everything i got a job started a study programme and i work out regularly and eat healthy i got over 80 of my anxiety and everything except of love is working out right now but i still feel pain i almost cannot handle and yes its physical pain like a broken leg just in my fucking head and its much worse than an injury i tried it all really i went to therapy medication everything i still relapse regularly i cannot do this i hope i have enough energy to buy a rope tomorrow i wont even write a suicide note cause i dont feel like iti am so fucked up

1,i am gonna kill myself i hate my fucking life i am so trapped alone and isolated it doesnt change hasnt changed in 5 years my parents are controlling i am 23 years old the only people who wanna be friends are fucking weirdos who want to masturbate to me and have sex with me you fucking losers kill yourselves i thought you were my friends you either leave me in the dust or just wanna fuck me i hate you you stupid fat ugly bitch losers why cant no one be genuine why does no one else care about me or wanna be my friend i m a loser and alone in this world i wanna end it all

1,i am scared of my own mind i thinki amsuicidal i don t know why or how but i feel it i just thought about and cried not sad cry or happy cry i cried like i m scared like i know i m suicidal but i don t know _ i cant think i m typing this now thinking about why i m suicidal or maybe i m just trying to get it out of me but _ i don t know i m scared of my own mind it s smarter than me my subconscious mind is smarter than my conscious mind and i think its trying to kill me i m scared when i look tot the future i see nothing there is nothing for me there i m scared i ve calmed down i still can t think but i m no longer crying i smoked 2 cigarettes and well i don t know i feel like i have no one to talk to i mean yes there is people to talk to my friend jake and my cousin marc my mom and dad but i feel like burdening them to tell them this or maybe i m just to scared to see the effect of telling this originally started out as a way to get my thoughts out rather than keeping them bottled up in my head where i usually keep them but i think i will post this to a suicide help subreddit no one can see me there i m just a name
1,i feel lost and ultimately stucki am not at immediate risk of suicide i feel okay right now but lately ive caught myself fantasizing about peaceful ways of suicidei am not even going through anything traumatic or anything but its incredibly unlike me to be suicidal or even give it a thought and i think its rooted from me moving out for the first time and not looking back i feel like ive made a mistake even thoughi ammaking decent money and am able to sustain myself with it i dont even know if this is just me being stupid and not liking the transition to adulthood i honestly have no idea but some days i just go numb and my mind wanders into suicidal territory not out of sorrow but out of a genuine longing to escape whatever the feeling i was experiencing wasim currently about to clock into work so i will probably stop replying for a few hours but i just wanted to get all of this off of my chest i havent told a soul out of fear that someone will just resort to this guys just being an attentionwhorehes got nothing to feel bad about not to mention its kind of a big deal to say to a family member that ive recently had suicidal thoughts anyway i appreciate you guys for listening to me mumble and this might not even be the right sub asi am not fixing to do the deed if thats the case go ahead and remove it as i will be away from reddit for a bit thanks 
1,failed attempt 1 month ago going again ive lost all motivation to do anything school work any activities even video games which i was completely addicted to only a year ago now i mainly just lay in my bed wondering why i even exist for hours on end ive legitimately thought about suicide ever since i was 13 with time this thought got worst and now at the age of 17 ive lost count of how many times i tried to take my own life just a month ago i had an extremely scary attempt i hung a piece of rope from my door and suspended myself so if i stood on my tip toes i could barely breath then i let my legs relax and swung them in front of me i was completely blacked out within a few seconds but then about 3 minutes later i just woke up for no apparent reason the rope didnt break and there was still full suspension on my neck but i still fucking woke up and survived i didnt leave a note or anything i just really really wanted to fucking die that nightthat was scary enough to make me stop for a month waking up with a rope around your neck cold with saliva running down your face slowly realizing where you are and what happened but now the suicidal thoughts return and i want to try again perhaps i should tell someone about my problems but theyd just call someone and take me to a hospital being someone who actually wants to die constant supervision at a hospital is not idealschool mainly instigates these suicidal actions i once cried for a whole night over the score i got on a practice test and i believe i came very close to killing myself that night too anything can trigger it i must just have a really fucking muscular neck because i can not kill myself via hanging i have tried literally 100 times now but i am going to keep trying
1,i dont think i will ever find love again i am 26 years old i am korean american but i really dont feel like i fit in either with fobs or americanized koreans ive had quite weird experiences in my life that has to do with religion and occultic stuff so i call myself isaac a long story that has to do with the name now anyways i am christian but not exactly a normal christian ive been quite popular with girls in some situations but there were many reasons why i couldnt get close to them i am kind of complicated anyways the other girls i dont really remember yet this one girland this other girl just not as much i dont think i will ever meet someone like that again i am not as attractive as i used to be i think she was my soul mate i wasnt ready and i am a failure i am contemplating suicide now i am so different from other people with radical beliefs and i am kind of weird most of the girls i know they dont fit me i would rather not start a relationship i can see going sour in the future honestly she was the only girl i ever met like that in my life i think she was truly rare anyone else feel like this
1,i 23 f am struggling with suicidal thoughts again and though i dont believe that i would go through with it its difficult to wake up every morning for a bit of background a lot has happened to me recently and this isnt the first time ive felt suicidal ive been quite depressed for the past year and a half at one point around 6 months ago i started writing letters to friends and family in preparation though i suspect it was mostly cathartici am not sure i will also note that three years ago i had a drug overdose that i believe was a suicide attempt but i am not quite sure i was sort of in autopilot that day at the momenti amfinishing my degree moving out am seeing a psychiatric who believes i have bipolar disorder and struggling with general feelings of sensitivity and selfhatei amcrying almost every day i truly believe that the people around me are sick of me andor hate me but feel obliged to stick around the heightened sensitivity has been the hardest hurdle as a small incident can make me withdraw completely for days on end for instance around a week ago my friend and roommate had invited me to see other friends but i had a prior commitment he said he had decided to go later and i said i might come too then and he ignored the statement and planned around me i literally cried about this for days and thought that he must hate me and must not want to be around me becausei amprobably a buzzkill or hes tired of me and he probably doesnt care at all if he didnt even try to give an excuse or anything this is an example of the small occurrences that have been setting me off and forcing me to reflect on my own lack of selfesteemi dont want to be around myself either but i dont have a choicei amscared of finishing my degree because i think i might want to do masters but my parents will be so ashamedi amscared of staying with my aunt if i dont find a new place to live soon enough and my lease is up in two weeksi amscared of getting diagnosed with bipolari amscared of losing everyone in my lifei amjust so tired and i want to sleep all of the time i dont have the capability to get through the next month i wish i could pause time and find a hotel room so i could just sleep and cry alone for half a year i really dont know what to doi amstruggling to live minute to minute

1,i survived a panic attack and feel proud of it these past 7 months have been awful since my depression came back ive been having panic attacks almost every night and its driving me nuts suicide thoughts every day for sure killing myself looked nice just to stop the panic attacks for oncehowever i faced it this time went outside took deep breaths i even downloaded this app called antistress and man this may sound stupid but it really helps and i could stop them this timeit feels so nice once you beat this shit i felt like sharing it because i know how hard this is to face depression face anxiety face panic but sometimes you just need to try a little and believe me its worth the try
1,i cant take being screamed at and hit any more i just got in a really big fight with my mom after she hit me and i yelled at her about how she doesnt care about me or make time for me and cares more about her canning she brushed me off because her beets shes canning are so fucking important and i amgonna fuck them up like i fuck up everything and then she said her councillor told her to ignore me and i am so mad because shes never let me have a councillor and she expects me to do everything myself and i amputting myself through college and working full time and its the first time ive been home in days and i was kinda excited to see her and i can hear her in the kitchen fucking canning beetsshe doesnt realize how much our fights affect me and how i cry for hours she started crying and now i can hear her laughing upstairs and i thinki amgonna go ahead and kill myself now because why should i live with people who hate me clearly she doesnt fucking care about me enough to just take one fucking minute to talk to me or even apologize so fuck you momthe worst part is i actually feel bad for making her cry and not accepting her initial apology but theres no wayi am going to say sorry shes never genuinely apologized to me in my life i know i have a responsibility in this fight and i have no problem apologizing and owning up but the fact that she thinks shes faultless is making me rip my hair out edit i was just looking at my last post about how much i hate her and i mention her not asking about my new job and surprise surprise one of the reasonsi am so hurt is she hasnt bothered to ask me howi am doing at my new job or school also i realize how much of a brat i sound like but these little things are killing me and i have no one to tell them to

1,the right to die in this world we live in every one stands up for their rights when they can we have people who stand up for marriage equality the right to lead the lifestyle they choose whether it be gay if you ask is being gay normal people get upset and say yes of course it is i was born gay they would possibly say people are becoming more persistent with their rights their freedoms people insist that they are to be referred to in a certain way sir madam regard transgender communities and get upset when they are not blah blah blah black lives matter white lives matter fucking this group that group everyone stands up for a cause they strongly believe in what about the right to die why cant we see this as normal all my life i have wanted to die i have lost count of how many times i have tried with overdoses one of the last few times i tried was by hanging only for things to go black and for me to wake up gasping for airfailed again other times people would always find me unconscious from the overdoses when i was pretty sure there was no way for them to and the door was locked and last week i took a whole batch of valium and alprazolam in a bowl washed it down with waterand apparently i was the one who called 000 and an ambulance i can get completely smashed with alcohol and remember what i do but my wife when she came home after the ambulance took me to the fucking hospital says that i had been vomiting in the toilet and somehow i went for the phone and dialed for the ambulance what the fuck i can not remember this is it a cry for attention no just so they can put me in an acute ward and i loose all my jobs that i do for a week and things just get fucking worse do i really want to die yes and no if we didnt live in this fucked up world of course not but we do so fuck yeah i want to die i am certainly not encouraging others to do so this is my choice i believe my rights just like everyone else thinks their rights are normal you can put me on all the fucking meds you like that is not going to stop my reasoning and thinking that i feel i have the right to die i can actually attest to this i am on them now so my question is why dont we have euthanasia clinics for those who see no way out and have lost all hope not just those for elderly terminally i will why dont we have those rights we lived in a fucked up world everyone screams for their rights and are getting them but for those who are suffering they cant choose to die humanly people dont give a fuck about the homeless those that are depressed suffering with mental i willness if you are living in poverty even though you work hard and do your best they look down on you if you are just a cleaner welfare agencies dont give a fuck if your suffering and cant go on there is no support for you while others bludge off the system and get away with it for years and years the risk of surviving a gun shot wound if its not done right and obviously how to hang oneself is can not work and cause prolonged damage as i found out we need assitance to do so safely humanely without the need for other people to discover you with pieces everywhere or at the bottom of a cliff this world is fucked and upside down

1,the grass is always brown i ve always been curious about death what it s like to fade out if anything truly happens after if there is nothing and living is all there is i want to experience literal nothingness in high school i was constantly in a state of depression and self harming i would make deep cuts on my thighs the pain felt like scratching an itch i couldn t reach and watching the flow of blood run down my legs and onto the shower floor was an over calming and intoxicating i started dating and freshman year became sexually active the scars and open wounds were embarrassing keeping me from doing much with women which turned a lot of them away but one stayed the first time she saw my scars she asked about them with a scared look on her face i didn t reply i was frozen she pushed her soft lips to my scars kissing them and telling me it was okay and i fell in love i then decided to quit self harm and months later turned to drugs to self medicate so to speak i graduated high school and worked at a pizza place and made some close friends especially with my shift leader who also would sell me marijuana i would work off the clock for him to improve labor cost and in return he would give me a discount and or give me a free pitcher of beer a few weeks later our manager found out somehow i was stealing alcohol and it turns out the same person giving it to me turned me in for it it was my word over his and i didn t want to make him to lose his job so i said nothing and quit arround the same time i was also going through a lot at home my fathers an alcoholic and physically verbally abusive my mother found out i was smoking marijuana and kicked me out i was jobless and homeless so i would stay with my girlfriend and other friends or just sleep in my truck at the river my girlfriend of 4 years went off to college and decided my baggage was to much she needed a break and wasn t willing to talk it out jobless homeless and girlfriendless i bounced arround girl to girl place to place put large amounts of drugs through my system trying to feel somthing other than sobriety when i was sober i was depressed one day i decided i needed out and wanted to better my life so i signed a military contract a few weeks befor i was going to ship to bootcamp my ex texted me begging for me back i was nowhere near over her and took her back with no hesitation i felt good i felt like my life was turning arround she asked if i had sex with anyone when we were apart and when i said yes and she hadn t it made me feel like i had cheated i feel guilty for having sex while we were apart and i don t understand it i went to bootcamp and 3 months later i m a marine i had broken my foot in basic so i was put into a medical platoon and it felt like purgatory doing nothing all day for another 6 months and suffering the consequences of other people s mistakes the thoughts and depression i hadn t felt months quickly came back fast forwardi amnow a year and a few months in i m currently in my final stage of training befor i get to my permanent duty job station i thought joining would improve my mental state giving me a purpose and somthing to do keeping me occupied but i haven t been more depressed me and my now fianc are doing great we have our small disputes but nothing major my parents couldn t be prouder of me and welcome me with open arms but i can t help but feel like shit i hate my life i hate living i m arrround hundreds of people every day i train with them i talk with them occasionally but i can t help but feel so alone and far from the people i love i truly don t think i can keep going and i feel like a bitch more or less for feeling this way when they re is people who have been to combat and seen things i can t imagine that have the right to feel this way i don t know what s wrong with me o can t talk to anyone about it or it ll be reported and i ll be stuck in holding for even longer and i don t want to scare my family so i can t talk to them i don t know what to do and i m slowly pushing my loved ones away i don t want to live anymore i feel like i ve made the worst mistake of my life the only way out is to do somthing and be discharged which would disappoint everyone i love so i m trapped i m not sure why i m posting this i guess i just need to get it off my chest

1,i like the idea of being 25 years old i will be surprised if someone reads this much less responds to this postanyway i have decided to go through with suicide and have made my plans vowed to myself and plan on retaining my commitment to suicide untili am25 years old why arent you going to kill yourself tonight or tomorrowor sometime soon this may be a question that briefly occupies your mind maybe not but its certainly a question that occupied my mind for some time the answer i have may seem weird or contradictory but i figured i would share it since this would be the firstlast time i will share it and becausei amwondering if someone else out there feels the same way or maybe someone canceled their plans of suicide doing the method in the answer i will be describingso the reason whyi amwaiting until i turn 25 to commit suicide is to see if i can make some of my ambitionsdreams come true i would like to try my best for a good or at least stable enough job to let me maintain a small apartment by myself be able to provide for myself and become truly independent strive to finish my schooling and get the degreei amworking towards even perhaps getting the ideal career i want then lets say i accomplish these goals by the timei am25 i would still plan on killing myself but at least i could do so with the knowledge that i tried to do something with my life its becoming increasingly difficult to continue forward with an almost 247 agonizing lonely and emotionally tormented hell constantly being a presence in my life i hate how my world has become so gray and dull to the point where everything i do has to be an act especially at this point in my lifei amonly acting for myself to attempt to convincelie to myself that there is some reason to be happy with my life some reason to keep moving forward i dont see myself finding such a reason to want to keep going on which isi amhere typing this post theres definitely more to say but i cant find the energy to actually finish right now so thank you for reading this weird lengthy af wall of text that ive been burying inside myself for many years

1,2 weeks from now i am going to say goodbye i dont know if i ll succeed this time but i think i will it will be painful but i promise myself the pain will only last for few seconds then there will be peace endless peace at least for me i dont know if its against the rules to post gruesome details of how will i do it but yes i ll jump on raging traffic and place my head under a tenwheeler truck i just cant find any other way a gun is way too expensive and i find jumping off a bridge from a building or by hanging being too cliche i dont want to be an inconvenience to the public but getting my head crushed is the easiest i could find at least it will guarantee my death enough with how i plan to end it but this is my storyill save you my personal information but so long as i can remember ive been depressed and suicidal for 7 years 6 and half to be precise since i wouldnt be here in october in anyway i started to develop depression after i was kicked out in the seminary goodbye reddit i know nobody or few would bother to read this but still bye
1,making plans to kill myself i cant succeed in anything i attempt and put effort into i am honestly running out of options and i feel the need to kill myself it feels like i cant succeed at anything i try and put effort into i might do it sooner if i continue to feel the way i am now i am going hang myself in the woods away from everyone i know so i can die alone
1,i dont know who i am anymore thats where i am at right now as i write this i ve been depressed for years now but the depression this time is different stronger i dont really feel down i just feel empty drained of everything that was ever considered me i rarely feel anything anymore or at least i no longer know how or what to feel things i used to enjoy i can no longer stand or no longer get any pleasure out of i have no motivation to do anything other than sleep and i only do things because i am obligated to my personality is gone as well and the feelings i ve had for those close to me are no longer there i am tired of not feeling tired of feeling like an empty shell unless a miracle happens between now and then theres no stopping me now ive gathered my materials and made my preparationsi amjust putting this here because i felt like i should at least get these things off my chest
1,derailing trains of thought things always get bad in the still of night and i am cold and i am getting incoherent and i am being paranoid and irritable and i cant get my mind to slow down i am thinking a thousand different things hundreds of trains on tracks fragmenting off into oblivion and i amrunning around trying to snatch up the bits and pieces of my sanity before they fizzle out its making me so crazy this perpetual frantic last ditch effort to grab these slivers of my mind becausei amfalling aparti am trying not toi am trying to handle it but it just isnt working i dont know what i think anymore maybe the truth is on one of those derailing trains of mine but by the time i get over to the wreckage to salvage some shred of it everythings engulfed in flames and ive got an entirely new set of thoughts dissolving away and demanding rescue this is so insanei am so insane you never realize your brakes are out until you slam on the pedal i could really use some conversation if anyone is out there 
1,i m going to a festival on my last day alive i got so fucking drunk last night was a huge embarrassment to my friends and ended up being taken home from a night out by police after i said i was feeling suicidal to my friend i am going to a festival today get my hands on as many drugs as i can and then take them all in one go i hate myself and i am ready

1,i am done with the loneliness and repetition i am not gonna sit here and say my life sucks wah i never get what i want etc but i just need to talk about this because might as well post it publically when no one thati amfriends with gives a crap so pretty much i thought that getting a job would help distract me from my depression but i think it got worse first offi amextremely lonely theres a girli aminterested in but i know for sure that even if i were to confess how i felt to her it wouldnt work out becausei ama garbage human i ve been seriously lonely for a long time and the only time ive ever had a so was in high school but then again she had autism so she most likely didnt care about me romantically then there was the other attempt i had at telling someone how i felt and she though said that she loved me left me to rot afterwards so you can see where i am getting at with being tired of being lonely all of the damn time theres that and theres also that i am an artist and thats been dragging me down lately too since i keep drawing but i never get better despite everyone telling me to practice and practice well gee nothing is getting better so it obviously isnt working i am just sick of it i dont even see a point in wanting to keep on living anymore because of my depression eating me away everyday i know i sound bitchy and whiny but i just want out i might buy myself a gun if i have to just to end it or maybe jump off the tallest bridge here in my city
1,ex keeps trying to prevent my death i dont get it i just want to die and someone who doesnt want to be with me keeps trying to make my life better i just cant understand i hate my life so much i havent done much with it except write a few stories here and there i am not confident in my future i hate when people leave me because they dont think i am right for them even though they say i make them happy and make their life better id rather make their lives better than my own but now she says shes so committed to preventing me from killing myself i hadnt even told her i had made plans to do it in the coming weeks i dont want to turn 22 and i want to die instead that would be a much happier birthday present i just cant fathom this why make me feel bad for wanting to be free from pain i dont see myself doing much in the future and all i can see myself doing is killing myself in some way

1,i wonder i always want to ask people if they would attend my funeral it doesnt really matter if they do or not i am just curious it sounds like i am directly saying i am going to kill myself right this instant so i dont but i want to ask even when i m not feeling 100 suidical just so i know and sometimes i feel like they should know its probably going to happen someday so they should think about whether or not they would attend and come to the terms i may die someday in the near futureand if they said they would i ask them not to bring up this or that its a little bit different than wondering if they care about you especially if its people you havent talked to in a while and its not the same as asking for help either
1,ama burden i dont contribute anything i just take and take and take thats what my stepdad said its so true i just take what i can get and survive i dont give anything i dont deserve a life all i do is take away from the universe
1,i thought i was okay i got a job a beautiful place to live had a great relationshipi amlosing my job and cant find a new onei amjust not good at anything anymore i am tired of fighting i am disgusting i wake up and the first thing i think of is shooting myself in the brain stem i havent been able to get out of bed in weeks now and my job is gone i have a degree in a field thirsty for workers yet cant find anything i am no good for no one nowi cant talk to anyone about my problems or my childhood all my friends died i am posting here because i know i should be but maybe this is just a formality ive typed out my note ten times already sorry for taking up your time i am glad there is a place like this to exercise my thoughts 
1,my life is a waste i m not really sure how much information is generally acceptable in these posts but since i m feeling this way for a lot of reasons i think it d be easiest to start with some background i m twenty years old and in my third year of college and i haven t done anything meaningful with my life i ve been ostracized by peers for as long as i can remember and i m trapped in a cycle of social anxiety that prevents me from being anything more than acquaintances with others i can t get a job i can t even get volunteer positions and i live with my parents and am financially dependent on them i feel like calling me a loser would be generousi m also struggling because i recently came out to my family and some relatives haven t taken it as well as i d expected one of them became very abusive until i backed off and basically retracted what i had said earlier about my identity before this i d been hoping to join lgbt groups on campus but now i feel like it would set people off and most of the people i ve met in the community are a lot more outgoing than i am and i feel really out of placei honestly don t feel like a person and i have nowhere to turn for support all i can think about is hanging myself and after at least ten years of feeling isolated and almost constantly suicidal i feel like i m finally reaching a breaking pointsorry this got so long

1,any event triggers suicidal thoughts any bad situation in my life no matter how insignificant it is makes me want to kill myself awkward social interaction being criticized by others etc not sure why this happens oftentimes i think something is seriously wrong with me and i lack the survival instinct others have since i want to give up on life so easily imo life is worthless and the bad moments greatly outweigh the good ones in quantity and quality so i dont care if i stop living

1,going to kill myself at school 
1,i am worried i m becoming suicidal i ve read and try to tell myself positive things i always counter it with something more negative thoughim getting scared that if i keep my mindset like this its going to continue getting worse and i am going to actually kill myself one day i dont know who to talk to though i feel pretty lonely contrary to my situation and i feel like perhaps i am pretending to be suicidal for attention maybe i am a shit person like that better to just keep it bottled up than to hurt someone
1,i dont know what to do about my friend so my friend and i have been best friends since the first year of middle school since then weve gotten really close and spent a lot of time together but he has never really opened up to me about anything personal one way or the other i found out recently that he had been cutting and having suicidal thoughts for a while now which he let slip over the course of a few conversations but always refused to talk about it further 
1,i want to tell her that i wont do it but i want to end it all so badly i want to message her and thank her for everything for being okay with the school asking her to be my buddy and sending me homework asking me if i am okay even though i could never respond truthfully because i didnt want to worry her but it hurts too much its so hard holding it in at times i just want to end it all i will never amount to anything and all i can do is hurt people no wonder all my friends left me i am selfish short tempered
1, i was going to kill myself it was so strange i sat on the ground next to the tree and listened to some music for a while since then my depression and suicidal thoughts are getting far far worse now to keep myself looking forward to something anything at this point i keep buying things off amazon i know it sounds stupid but it seems to work for now anyway i cant get to a doctor and i am not on any medications my situation leaves me pretty isolated except to go to college and come home i am not looking for advice or anything i just wanted to tell someone i dont really have any friends so i guess this is the next best thing 
1,i dont think i can do the life thing anymore i never thought i d be writing a post here i always thought i was strong i always thought it wouldn t get to this but everything s changed i guess my anxiety is so bad i don t think i want to live with it anyone anything that i could possibly worry about i worry about my anxiety is so bad it always gives me phantom pains and i convince myself i m having a heart attack or a stroke or some shit i don t wanna feel anymore i just wanna be gone i wanna be free from this pain i am crippled i am drowning
1,i just feel that i am not worthy of life i am tired i dont sleep i wanna help people but i cant help myself i really think about going back to alcohol or something like that to stop me thinking about it or maybe i am really newbie about happiness that i dont know how to feel about it thank you for reading this i just felt that i have to put it out of my system

1,i know my worth but whats the point of no one else sees it i am a really smart person i know at least a little bit about everything i dont know i ve always wanted to go to utah for some reason and watch my favourite show one last time all the way thought then put a gun in my mouth maybe watch it over 2 or 3 days in a hotel and then do it just to feel emotions one last time nothing makes me happy anymore i kicked drugs but i ve been abusing alcohol for months now do you know what it feels like to feel like you could accomplish anything but no one would acknowledge it do you know what its like to dream of something since you were a kid only to realise life passed you by because of your mental i willness

1,i dont want to live anymore the only thing keeping me alone is the thought of disappointing friends and family i ve had a pretty decent life all in all parents that werent abusive or anything i got to live in a nice place most of my life and my family has paid for many things for me but i dont want to be around anymore why cant a car just hit me then i wouldnt be responsible for being such a fucking failure what can i do
1,i d be just another gun control statistic i had the gun loaded and against my head i kept repeating every negative thought about my life my failures worthlessness and how people would be better without me i was in a lot of emotional pain and ready to go through with it it wasn t the thought about there s so much to live for or you can get through this or even thinking about loved ones that stopped me if was the fact that once my body was found there would probably be a news story about another death by gun

1,concerned about a classmate before an exam yesterday i kept hearing this girl that sits down the row from me telling her friends multiple times very loudly she would slit her throat with her exam afterward started describing the bloody mess that would occur i believe she was probably joking because of her laughter but would it be appropriate to ask her if shes ok and give her a list of emergency and other resources she can contact and what should i do if she says she was just joking
1,i hate myself so much i feel guilty for existing and its eating away at me and i cant take it anymore even just talking to people makes me feel guilty because why should i expect anyone to want to talk to me i wouldnt want to talk to myself i am such a worthless disgusting piece of shit i have nothing to contribute why should i expect anyone to waste any of their energy on could as well kill myself

1,it took me 10 minutes to get back here 10 minutes ago i was okay for a week it was because of my brothers wedding and in only 10 minutes i got fucking suicidal again dropped so deep again i am not planning to do it tonight but this could change in the next 10 minutes and i could be on my way in only 20 minutes the biggest problem is that there is no wedding or other event in sight so i wont come out of this soon and i was never as deep as i was before the wedding and i am really close to this again to be honest i m pretty sure i will end up doing it this week maybe today
1,25m havent talked to anyone in almost a year lost girlfriend lost religious beliefs dropped out of college 2 years ago i think last years have been a loop jobless penniless 150 in my name i cant trick myself into enduring misery any longer nor would it be an act of love ending this would sort of be the biggest show of love i could do to myself actually fuck i even feel ashamed for having written a post on suicide watch when i am feeling suicidal i cant even do a suicide watch thread properly 
1,a suicide attempt feels inevitable i just started a new job and its really stressful its alot to learn and i dont know if i can do it i am only doing it cause my roomates want me to take this job and its the only one available i ve also been informed that they dont really care for me i am just trapped here i keep thinking i am going to have to kill myself there is no other choice i have no where else to go and the only people around me have made it clear they dont care that i am struggling they call me crazy this would be my second attempt i dont want to but there is nothing else for me to do
1,there are so many fucked people out there and i dont want to be one of them i am alone with all this and i cant tell anyone about it it sucks it sucks living with this inside me knowing that no one in the world can help mei could tell my therapist but what could she ever do for me nothing it sucks but if its true its really scary since there is no cure or anything its just the way i am and its terrible 
1,i decide to live for maybe one more year i realize life is precious and that even though nobody care about me and only call me autism and fucking stupid little fuck that i should still live no marrer wat problems i have even if they make me want to go mad and cause a cataclyms
1,method used in chris cornell and chester benningtons suicides i know this is kind of morbid but given that crime scene photos have leaked and that both were exceptionally interesting and beautiful human beings has anyone explained exactly how chester and or chris committed their acts of suicide i know both of them hung themselves with simple household items in chris case he used workout resistance bands in chesters case he used a belt in both cases it seems as though there was no significant drop and they therefore died via strangulation cutting off blood or choking cutting off air not via neck injury i ve always been under the impression that it was fairly difficult to make a reliable noose using these types of items in part bc of the high suicide failure rate particular among women and in part bc i ve never researched or thought about it too deeply however the fact that both chris and chester succeeded makes me think that creating a reliable device is easier than i realized and that many failed suicide attempts are not actual suicide attempts but rather deliberate failures as a cry for help i totally sympathize with both those who actually commit suicide and those who attempt suicide as a cry for help i ve desired the courage to carry out both types of acts in the past and can see how one may do such a thing 
1,one of my closest friends is planning to kill himself by the end of this week his father is an abusive alcoholic and he gets bullied at school i am the only one who knows this were both 15 hes almost killed himself twice before both times i ve talked him out of it but this time it seems he has his heart set on it and i dont know what to do
1,i think i need help in my current situation i have no friends i am shy and have anxiety i am too scared to talk to anyone in real life including therapist and i planned out my entire suicide
1,i have accepted that i will kill myself i think i am now approaching that point i came to this belief last week i was at my therapist and i said it out loud i told him that i likely would not do it soon but that my long term mental health suggested that would be the way i d go that seems like a shitty thing to do to someone who is trying to help we agreed to break our arrangement he said he would follow up with references to a psychiatrist and a life coach having had plenty of experience with i willegal drugs and limited experience with prescription drugs i doubted that a scrip would help all the same he could forward me the reference i see no reason to keep going i dont know what to do or what will help i want an answer to fall out of the sky i hope that it does for all of you
1,i am going for a walk and i want to be hit by a car or mugged so i can die and make it look like an accident that way my family wont feel ashamed that their only son committed suicide it will be considered a tragedy realistically i am going to probably going to have to walk across a red light on a certain street that i know always has trucks going across it i guess you can consider this my last note goodbye

1,i have no idea the only reason i havent killed myself is because i dont want to make others sad i am not happy but i am not sad either i take other peoples idea of their own happiness and make it mine i feed off of other peoples idea of life because i dont have my own any relationship ive ever been in was only to give the other person what they wanted mei am so ready to give up because i truely honestly have no idea what i want out of life or what i want for my self i have no goals or ambitions or dreams of how i want my life to be i just do what others expect out of a person and that is simply to not give up on life 
1,unprepared for this peace to expire i ve thought about suicide and cried a lot todayi must have written and then deleted several pages of text by now so how about if anybody really wants to donate their time and energy to listening to me then ask me what you want to know and we can take it from there currently i have a reasonable comfortable existence for many many reasons my current living situation cannot last its with my parents i dont know of anybody else that would be willing to have me live with them when this uneasy compromise out of necessity ends knowing myself i think its likely that i will end up killing myself right now i dont want to kill myself if i did i wouldnt run the risk of spoiling my chances by telling somebody and i wouldnt use a method that has a chance of being interrupted or failing thats why its important that i talk about this now because i dont when i make plans
1,my parents are so strict all they want me to do is study and it makes me want to die have you talked to them about this you can bring it to their attention that this is a highly inefficient parenting method for trying to get you to make good grades

1,a friend of mine wanted to kill himself at a party last saturday at a party i myself had struggle with suicide in the past but i found inspiration in the unexpected i never talked someone out of suicide and i hope i didnt make things worse i just wanted to share this to kinda take it out of my system and try to understand this whole situation from different perspectives
1,probably wont ever kill myself i think about it as an option every now and then but theni amlike well from an honest utilitarian perspective theres better options than the finality of death my death would hurt some people pretty much regardless of any other circumstances so i can live with my unhappiness maybe i can dedicate my life to helping others nah too much work well if my life is going nowhere i could join the military but i keep hearing that its really boring after training work that they dont need a human to do maybe i will just do what i like hah like i have that much dedication just live and work to pay for my survival while distancing myself from others to avoid hurting them i am too much of a pussy for that well shit
1,looking for an easy out i have no reason to be depressed and while i have never been clinically diagnosed i have bouts where getting out of bed is the hardest task i ve faced my life from the outside makes some jealous single good job nice car etc but i am worn i am a caretaker of someone close to me and i am the go to person for many friends i am a good listener and i believe i have set the precedent that i can listen but dont need to be listened to now for fear of the effects on my job and personal endeavors if i admit my suicidal desires it would cause additional stress that would be counter productive i dont want to commit suicide out of desperation or even dark depression i want to just because its easy logically i understand why i shouldnt but selfishly and truly selfishly i want to

1,here i am again for some stupid reason i am still alive i am about to flunk out of grad school but i guess sometimes part of me is still holding out hope that that wont happen even worse the most likely outcome is that i wont fail out but i will be here a really long time as a pain in the ass mediocre student that the professors cant wait to get rid of i dont know why i dont just end it all now its all i can think about but i dont have the courage

1,a gun is surprisingly not that hard to get
1,this could be the end screw myself i am so fake cannot take this anymore i dont feel connected to the world or to anybody i feel like a distant observer not being able to interact genuinely whats the point of continuing and pushing thru when in the end i gotta suffer for the rest of my lifei amjust peering out my eye sockets not even knowing myself which is the worst am i going crazy or is this just another emotional phase all i know is this cant keep going on or i will pull someone down with me which in this time is my family i cant seem to let anybody into my life be close to a person even having a friend i dont know if the past made me this way having being sexually abused as a kid months back when i got better i thought i could change my mentality but in reality its just a character i want people to see me its fake i admire people who are just themselves they seem to have a soul and a life but i am just a empty shell useless scared and alone 
1,getting ducks in a row i feel like i ve run out of gas i ve been putting so very much energy into fighting my depression and ideations while trying so hard to help myself through transitioning months ago i had a week long vacation with my best friend planned we were going to gencon for the first time ever that very first day i had of of work i attempted to kill myself and feel i came close i was found by another suicidal friend and she with my best friend nursed me back i didnt want to survive and have been wrestling with that since i ve been crying and stuck on the couch since yesterday ive now cancelled plans this week and therapy appointments today i documented my assets and where i am intending them to go i ordered the second part of my suicide plan online and it arrives any day its been tough not being rash while i wait for the package and falling back to another method but i didnt follow my plan the first time suicidal friend had wanted previously to make a suicide pact with me but she doesnt know how bad off i am yet peace and i can only hope that those i hurt so much can themselves move on
1,i am still alive or why i cant die yet there are two reasons why i havent killed myself the first is that i dont want my mom to outlive me shes been through so much and worked so hard to be happy that i absolutely cant kill myself while shes alive i couldnt do that to her so thats reason 1 reason 2 is ridiculous i feel like i cant kill myself until ive done something worthwhile until ive succeeded at accomplishing something notable publishing a bestseller making a million in the stock market whatever something that justifies the fact that for a brief moment i was alive only when ive found that peace will i be able to die i absolutely refuse to kill myself now and die a failure id be fine killing myself if i were successful and theres that tiny sliver of hope an irrational hope trying to keep me alive by refusing to let me succeed does this make any sense good night
1,why cant i just turn life off everyday when i am trying to sleep i hope to not wake up it would be perfect i just cant understand so many things that it drives me crazy i just want to turn me off in a way that will not hurt my parents but even this is hard for me 
1,sometimes i want to end my life because of codependent relationship with nmom working on improving myself to get better job so i can move out 
1,why what s the point i genuinely don t understand why i m still here i don t see a point to living we all die eventually and nothing in this world matters why live a life when you re sad all the time and there s no end gamei feel like i m getting more and more disconnected from reality by the day and there s nothing that can be done to change how i feel i want to go ahead and get life over with it doesn t make any sense anyway
1,what is happening to me i am going mad i am not quite sure how long i ve been feeling this way but i can tell you that it feels like its been forever i cant remember the last time i was genuinely happy lately i ve been feeling extremely lifeless and hopeless time is flying by and i feel numb to that i am just going through the motions of life i have quite a bleak outlook on my life and i often think nothing will get better and theres nothing i can do about my situation i ve lost interest in things that used to bring me joy i cant seem to get myself out of bed in the mornings i often feel like theres a huge build up of anger and anxiety in me so ive found a toxic coping mechanism that coping mechanism is cutting and burning my own skin i am aware that its toxic and extremely bad but it helps make me feel so much better
1,its inevitable i wish it wasnt today is really hard every day is hard i dont know how much longer i can make my way through life i wont kill myself but it feels fixed and i dont think theres any way for me to recover and soi am in limbo
1,here not looking for help with preventing my death but help with making it happen please dont try to give me the dont do it stuff i think what you guys do is great but in my situation id rather you help me do the opposite i need help with mentally preparing myself and whatnoti just need that blueprint or whatever if you cant post it here then messaging me would work too thank you
1,tonight is the night i do it goodbye i hope you ve made the best decision for yourself

1,life is boring first theres indoctrination memorizing pointless information and spitting it back out not understanding why youre then left at an awkward stage after school not knowing what the point of anything is so you get a job so you can live on your own maybe you meet someone along the way who does the same after 45 years of suffering at your dead end job that didnt go anywhere you decide to retire with the little money you both have saved and are finally able to rest without worrying about tomorrow after 10 more years you die not knowing what any of life was for questioning why you put up with so many problems and why you pretended to care for so long and why you didnt just end it when you knew it was going to be like this at 13 
1,i hate myself texted my ex of 2 years ago today everything is adding up i moved across the country for a good job and i am still laying in bed at night wishing i could blow my fucking brains out
1,relieved to be able to say how much i want to die anywhere even anonymously even mentioning in normal life that i dont feel my life has purpose or meaning gets me pity and pep talks at best and not terribly subtle hints to stop the conversation or withdrawal from friendships at worst and while i dont know for sure what saying offline that i want to die and in fact have multiple plans with multiple pro and con lists in my head would get me
1,i dont feel alive and i am not depressed however ive been thinking about my future and whether its worth it i still study hang out with friends etc and i would feel like myself but when i am stuck doing hw or something late at night the thought of death doesnt intimidate me like i always have this thought everyone dies its just a matter of when u dieunless ur steve jobs or abe lincoln a majority of things u did wont matter after death this leads me to believe that theres no point in trying to make a difference in the world bcuz i will die in a couple of decades unlessi amsteve jobs or something i have goals family and friends and i am in a decent situation my social life at school could be alot better and i would appreciate less hw and testsjust a little ranti am really bored and stuck doing hw

1,feeling clear i have felt suicidal for around 57 years i normally feel suicidal when i am very sad usually thinking of suicide as a way to stop being a burden on my family today i did not feel sad i felt very clear i felt like the best option for me was to disappear i do not feel like i can function in society i am ashamed of what i have done and how i have treated those who tried to love me i do not pity myself at all the condition i am in is all because of my own actions i feel certain that my life will not get any better although i couldnt possibly know that honestly i am afraid i feel disguting in my own body i feel like every second i spend in it is almost torturous
1,still here all i am doing right now is existing and going to school and tricking my mind into thinking that life is worth living for such and such passions which dont even make me feel any sort of excitement or happiness anymore i cant socialize trust me ive tried many many times i dont know what its like to be valued by someone else as much as i want to live to get rich and find happiness i have come to realize that the journey to seeking happiness is somewhat a false hope kind of thing and i figure that even if i reach my goals i still wont be any happier or any less lonelier than i am today besides i think being dead is better than suffering through every single second of my life my existence is literally pointless why not put an end to this ridiculousness

1,i dont know what to do about my girlfriend this is such a tricky situation and i dont know what to do i started dating my current girlfriend 2 years ago we met online via a game and have been in a long distance relationship though weve met up dozens of times and have stayed with each other for weeks at a time sometimesboth of us have dealt with depression for a long time and when we started dating she was the sole reason i wanted to stay alive still it feels reversed nowadays i still love her a lot and she loves me but my depression has gotten so much worse since i started seeking help which i gave up on because my life felt considerably worse when i started acknowledging the depression and i am an even more negative person now than i was back then i think this may have pushed on to her and now we are just a rolling ball of negativityit feels like it is going to push me over the edge to suicide but i also feel that if i leave her i will be pushed over the edge to suicide because i dont have anything going for me if i dont have her on top of that it would crush her and the guilt itself in that would just fuck me up i dont know what to do should i just try and get over it and push through until it feels like it is getting better should i risk leaving her ending in a likely suicide for me and a possible one for her i am not even good for her i amsuch an awful emotional support i cant even support myself how can i support hereven if i did decide to break it off with her i have no idea how this is the first and only relationship ive ever been in and i really dont think id ever find someone else that would be willing to be with me that i also like but putting future possible relationships aside if i continue living to even have a second i dont know what i should do about this oneim so lost and confused and i dont know what i can do about it please help mei am sorry i came here instead of or but they wouldnt understand the depression situation like i feel a lot of you would

1,i posted on here 19 days ago and very little has changed things have slowly gone downhill despite all thats happened in the past 19 days id say two weeks within those 19 days were fairly unforgettable but i genuinely miss the circumstances in which those two really three and a half weeks were spent the only person i have really any true feelings for is quite hard to get through despite what i vaguely know i dont even know how they truly feel about me part of me says why bother but i know i cant regardless the past fourfive days have been almost a blur ive gone out for walks everyday for five six hours at a time i still feel manage to feel worse i keep coming to the same conclusioni am not sure why i even bother waking up theres a quote by vladimir lenin i read thats stuck with me it seems very relevant but i still dont know no matter what i do or try whats the point just offing myself seems the best option theres very little for me to do other wise suicide amongst a few important things is the only thing on my mind its very tempting at this point
1,why am i so sad 247 halfway past high school i started feeling this way but since my mother doesn t really believe in psicological i willness i ve never really tried to figure out what was wrong now i m a freshman in college and things were getting better related to that subject but since summer everything just got worst i have suicidal thoughts again like do i really matter people would even notice if i m not around would they even care do they care my boyfriend is super worried about me only because we end up fight in my crisis and they affect him so how but he never even asks me if i m okay i end up crying almost every day everything always gets so blue somehow sometimes because of the fights but mostly everything gets so confusing and overwhelming in my head that i can t help to be mad or cry usually both i want help but will a talk with a psychiatrist really help he will give me medication but they can make things worst not better

1,that voice inside your head what does it say to youi ve been in counseling and heard it described as intrusive thoughts and inner monologue it s suggested that the voicevoices and phrases you constantly repeat in your head is depression itself almost like a separate entityi m curious what phrases other people hear when they are in their lowest state here are some of minepeople would be better off without you you re nothing it will only get worse you only cause others pain you re a failure you re worthless just give up you deserve to die life is not worth it anymore what s the pointso what are some other things that run through your mind when you are seriously contemplating suicide perhaps if we see others going through something similar it can help us all know we are not alone

1,always praying and wishing for death this is going to be long i dont know what to do or where to go ive never felt so lost in my life and i know all the sequence of events that got me here but i was too young to control them and the adults around me too foolish to see themi dont know what i want from writing this but i need to vent ive cried myself to sleep the last few nights and i only want to die i only want deaths sweet embraceif i dig deep back to my earliest memory its me eating a bowl of corn flakes with orange juice there is no earlier memory this was before prek age 4 it was only when i started going to preschool that i realized something was differentparents talked to their kids they hugged them they laughed with them they told them that they love them it blew my 4 year old mind wide open my parents didnt do that my eyes are getting waterymy parents never hugged me never told me they loved me and never gave me affection by any standard in the united states at least i felt no love growing up and watching the people around me it hurti have 3 older siblings our age gaps range from 410 years we grew up like strangers because of our parents yet we lived in the same house my two older brothers always treated me like shit and i was the punching bag i always got the worst of it i never really spoke to them growing upat school i didnt make too many friends i think by the time i hit first grade i was already broken i had no one to talk to at home my parents frequently beat me with wooden spoons hot pans belts metal side too flip flops fists etc my siblings beat mei dont remember having friends i remember loneliness and crippling depressionin 7th grade i was introduced to public school in a new state it was my first time going to public school being brown i was called a terrorist immediately and bullied i tried to defend myself but i was scrawny and weak i used to have so much patience at this time in my lifeit was slowly erodedat school it was just bullying and harassment at home it was just bullying and harassment bullied by peers parents and siblings i only wanted to die i knew i wanted death for a long time at this point but i was too scared i held a knife to myself many times but i was always too scaredi went through middle school and high school creating a facade that i was happy that i wasnt suffering from crippling depression everyone believed it including my family through middle school and high school i probably cried myself to sleep almost every night i had giant bags under my eyes which i still have to this day at 24 i would pray to god on a daily basis to kill me to end it all or help me end it all i went to a private catholic school before 7th grade and being young and impressionable i really believe in life after death i believe suicide will send me to hell which is somewhere i dont want to go i suffered so much in this life already how can i kill myself and go somewhere to suffer for eternity i dont know what i want out of writing this but i just really want to die so badlyi felt better in college i felt less alone but even having a gf or a few friends i still felt itmy baseline emotion at this point was crippling depressioni realized i dont know how to actually make friends i have had so so very few friends in my life i have no one to talk to and loneliness is killing meno one really knows but i partially joined the military after college in hopes of finding that connection people speak ofim looking for that now and i realize its just like anywhere else i still have trouble making friends and i really dont know how to fix it some people i just click with maybe like 1 out of 500 and the rest i just dont have anything to talk about i dont know what to say i dont want watch any sports i dont like that stuffi amweird and i always try and keep that happy facade uplately the loneliness and stress have just been adding up that i cant help but cry myself to sleep i just want a friend i just want someone to talk to i just want to die i pray to god that i can get into some kind of car accident where only i will get hurt and die i pray i can die in my sleep i pray to have a heart attack to get cancer to die some sudden death or get run over i pray that god takes the breath from my lungsi dont love anyone on this planet i have no desire to stay here i have no attachments all ive ever wanted in this life is to have my own family someone to love that loves me back and children to raise properly a real family not the bullshit hand i was dealtbut its hardmy parents let me eat like garbage growing up we never went out to eat but all i really ate was cheese and pasta my body never properly developed if you look closely my head is smaller than most males as is whats between my legs they are both closer to a childs my body even though people thinki ammuscular is soft and pudgy i am undeveloped my emotions are a mess my mind is a mess i dont know what to do with my lifei dont know whyi amwriting this or what i want i just know that if i was offered the opportunity to die i would take it in a heartbeat the only thing that stops me from killing myself is the fear i will go to hell but oh my goshi wish someone would kill me the loneliness and pain in my heart is so crippling it hurts living each day everyday i stop caring about hell just a little bit because i want to leave this world i want the pain to end i want the torrent of emotions in my mind to stopedit i think i know what i want i mean i want friends i want people to talk i want to be normal but i know that takes timefor a while i used to be good at taking my mind off these things and finding an escape but the crippling depression and desire to die has become too overwhelming it invades my every thought i want to know how i can get out of this i want it to stop until death can find me until i die i need these thoughts to be gone i know thats whats good for me but its just so hard when pain and mental despair is all you know
1,this is cross posted from the depression sub and also just because right nowi am not doing so well this is my storyi am34 years old and i have lived with depression for the last 18 years of my life each year it gets worse and worse there are days where i just do not want to get out of bed there are days wheni amoff from work that i do not get out of bed i just lay in bed eat junk and just watch tv or youtube all day long and frankly that is just what i want to do with my time off i dont want to do anything that is extra work i just feel drained and lazy most of the time from my depressionit hurts and what hurts even more is that i do not have anyone in my real life that seems to care i have come out with saying that i am depressed and all i got from my mother wasi am sorry you are sad sadness and depression are two different things she doesnt understand and she is not willing to understand she told me to snap out of it i cant snap out of itmy depression about four years ago really took a nose dive it got horrible and that was the day i learned about mom and dad getting a divorce they told me about it first thing in the morning on my 30th birthday it hurt it hurt a lot to tell me first thing in the morning about it all she didnt stop there she decided to tell me all about my dads new girlfriend and that i also had a new half brotheri felt rotten that entire day this is where people look at me really funny but i found something later that day that did make me happy and something that did make me smile or should i say someonei came home from work and i turned the tv on i sat there for a few moments in this kind of trance because i still couldnt believe what was going on in my life i was suddenly snapped out of that trance as i looked back at the tv the colbert report came on i had never seen it before so i gave it a shot the first thing that ran through my mind was oh he is cute but then later on as i watched it more i began to laugh and smile that was the first time i had smiled that day and in a long time i started to look forward to that feeling every daynow you may laugh at me plenty do ive been called weird and crazy for it franklyi amat the point now that i dont care that is the only thing i have to look forward to every day that is the only thing that keeps me going through the day is getting home and watching him before i go to bedafter a while i did develop a crush go figure anyways on to more about my adventures here i started to get a little bold and i would go to the dirty role playing subs here i would post ads for role plays of where i would want people to play him and help me play out some of my fantasies because i enjoyed that feeling and also it was just something else to engage my brain in something that kept me focused on something i like and not thinking about my depression more and feeling badbut that didnt work out the way that i wanted to it only gained the attention of trolls and they trolled me hard to so hard thati amnow banned from those subs they ruined something that i loved something that gave me a fucking reason to live because my fucking parents sure as hell dont do thathell this post might attract trolls and i know that was just an invite to be honest ive been crying as ive been writing out this post i was told by someone to just start a post here and just write write whatever came to my mind so here it is take it or leave it read it or ignore it laugh at me or dont chances are someone already has

1,boiling over ive always been very personal and private about my depression and anxiety i always wanted to keep it all to myself and maybe i could help someone by sharing my story but the time for that has never comei am not embarrassed of what ive done rather scared that no one would be able to look at me the same if they knew the first time i really tried to kill myself i took a handful of oxy and went for a drive expecting not to be able to react it was between 13am on a weekday in 2014 i drove my favorite canyon road by the time i got to the end of the road everything went black and i woke up a few hours later pulled over safelyi am not sure why i pulled over or why i didnt just let myself crash but i didnt the next year i spent most every day on some kind of hard drug intermittently trying to od but it never worked then january 5th of 2015 after a terrible acid trip and even more terrible interaction with people i thought cared about me i tried to end my life i wrote 6 letters to my sister my mom my dad and my 3 closest friends i snorted half a gram of ketamine drank 13 of a bottle of fireball and took all the valium that was prescribed to me that month about 60 pills and slit both my wrists i was living at home with my parents after dropping out of college my dad travels 3 or more weeks out of every month and my mom was staying with my grandmother who was dying and if my dad had time off hed stay with them in california and leave me with the house to myself my parents never knew of my addiction or how bad i had gotten back to january 5th my parents were home but used to me not leaving my room for days at a time and my mom busts into my room at around 3pm on the 7th and pulls open my blinds and yells that its time for me to do something anything and storms out of my room slamming my door and as unlikely as it may seem i came to my sheets were bloody the letters still sat on my night table next to my bed and my mom didnt even look at me or the slew of drugs and alcohol on my night table the only thing i remember from my attempted suicide was becoming very cold and seeing nothing but black until i saw just my own face emerging from the blackness i didnt interact with myself i didnt say anything or rather dont remember saying anything and the peaceful darkness of me staring at my own face in darkness was interrupted by my moms voice of her barging in my room for the next 4 months i went back to school and wore long sleeve shirts well into spring break when i finally slipped my family and i went out for family dinner and i wore a long sleeve sweater and as i reached across the table to grab something my mom saw my scarred wrist i had been waiting for them to heal enough so that i could get a tattoo to cover them up but they were badly scarred and unsightly i never told anyone what happened that night other than telling my mom i tried to kill my self months earlier i have never been afraid of death nor the repercussions of killing myself until my family sat me down and each of them told me how it would have affected them and how it would affect everyone that knew me this didnt scare me but made me feel terrible made me feel even more like a burden and i knew id never be able to escape their fears of me attempting again for the next year i got daily check ins from my family which inevitably slowed as the year progressed and finally the anniversary was upon me again and overwhelmed with emotion i attempted again however this time i just tried to od on sleeping meds and barbiturates i had been living with my best friends and their girlfriends in a house near my school and when i attempted i believe this was the closest i got to death i started having extreme trouble breathing my heart was racing my vision was blurry and i was terrified i made a last ditch effort to throw up some pills after i made myself throw up i passed out in my shower in my room again never told anyone and no one was the wiser that this had just occurredi am not sure how i could help anyone with this story but i always hoped that maybe i could help someone feeling like they cant go on like they are afraid every day that they could take their own life but the truth is i still feel that way after all the therapy ive gone through after all the experiences that have gotten me here i still have a daily thought about how id do it again about how i wont fail next time all the while trying to be there for my friends in their times of weakness and there for my family to try and be the goofy light hearted sonbrother theyd known its just not me anymore and its lonely knowing i have to keep these things to myself so i dont scare or put stress on those around me on those who still care about me 
1,me again not looking to be talked out of it this time i posted here before and was convinced not to end it allowing myself to be convinced was a mistake there are cliffs not far from where i live and i plan to throw myself off them at some point within the next week not looking to be talked out of it just wanted to tell someone whats happening 26 years is long enough and my relatives and friends will no doubt be much happier oncei amno longer there to burden them
1,everything was going so well i didnt hardly have anything to eat last payday i had enough to eat and have gas to get back an forth to work all this payday because i was getting caught up on bills my car loan company took the money out a week early so now i have no food to eat they gave me the we apologize for the glitch in our system but we dont issue refunds i told them i would report it to my bank as fraud then a supervisor got on and said if i did then if i was ever late again they would repo my car so here i sit with no food again looking at a knife and thinking about ending it all i just think about how nice it was last week eating three meals everyday i wanted to go to the food bank but they were only open till 11am and i had to work they dont open till tuesday and close before i get off of work i cant stand going hungry any more i dont know what to do
1,i am alone i have a gun i need a dog my husband is out of town to meet up with some of his fraternity brothers for a football game at their alma mater no pets no kids i am too ashamed of my feelings to call anyone i am okay 80 of the time but i suffer from sporadic bouts of depression that include really intense suicidal thoughtsurges there is a loaded gun in the top drawer of my nightstand for protection my kitchen is full of knives my medicine cabinet has an industrial sized bottle of ibuprofen the liquor cabinet and wine rack hold enough for more than one person i have only told my husband about these feelings once i didnt want to he was driving us to family dinner at my parents house a little ways away and i started feeling the overwhelming sense of uselessness and wishing i didnt exist while looking at the cement construction barrier to my right i was taking deep breaths to calm myself but that isnt an instant fix the tears started pouring down my face and my husband not the most observant although super loving and supportive noticed he thought hed done something wrong he was worried i told him oh its stupid sometimes i get overwhelmed with feelings of uselessness and i feel like the world would be way better without me in it i will be fine it just takes awhile for these feelings to go away he assured me loves me and he would be devastated if anything ever happened to me as would my family my friends my coworkers would miss me and for sure one of my bosses would be absolutely lost without mewhen i was a teenager i would have really vivid dreams in which i would die in some new horrible fashion every night i am not exaggerating it was worse when i would workout its no different now at 28 my mind has gotten more creative it lures me into dreams where my life is perfect then little by little like picking flaking paint off an old door with your fingernails it starts to fall apart if i have a garden the plants start to die or turn poisonous slowly infecting the ground and working its thorny vines into my perfect house and tearing apart everything inside with an agonizing slowness i can do nothing to stop the vines wrap around me and hold me as my husband opens the door i try to scream to warn him but i amchoking they stab him through the heart and slowly crush me while he slumps against the door frame dying once hes dead the vines release me only to fell me with a similar blow before i can escape i die knowing that the vines will claim anyone who comes near the house to check on things when i wont answer my phone or my husband hasnt shown up at the office or responded to clients in days its my fault i planted the garden in high school i had pets lived with my parents and two sisters and had lots of friends nearbymy family is only an hour away but i dont want to let them know whats going on my husband is out of town and i dont want him to worry i have one friend in my new city and i dont know her all that well and i dont want her to thinki amcrazy i feel like someone is sitting on my stomach with one hand on my chest and the other forcing my face to look at the nightstand while listing off all my flaws fears shortcomings and failures i know what they want i know whats in the top drawer just inches below my hand thats gripping its top i am waiting for my sanity to come save me i am typing this hoping that part of myself that wants to live and knows that there is too much to do to die right now shows up soon the part that still isnt my biggest fan but holds way too much pride to let me fail too bad the side of me that says you really shouldnt do that its so weak selfish and shameful think of your mom think of your dad what would they do would you really put them through sorting through all your shit to find some clue you didnt leave your husband would be so ashamed how could he feel okay about having people over to comfort him with all this mess you should get up and clean something this is ridiculous not to mention youre overweight what would they bury you in none of your nice things fit anymore at least lose some weight and clean the house first we can revisit this theni need a dog not even a therapy dog just a dog feeding myself is not reason enough to get out of bed taking care of myself is not enough for me to go for a walk my need and my husbands need to live in a clean and healthy home is not enough to move from our bed but i do have a friend coming over tomorrow night shell definitely think i was crazy if i didnt call or answer the door when she got here if i had a dog though i would have gotten up hours ago to feed it and let it out i am not enough to live for but i have had a dog before that dog was my life i am living to get to a point in my life where it wouldnt be irresponsible or inconsiderate to get a dog life is too busy and uncertain right now and it wouldnt be fair to the dog but i really need one right now edit i need something external to push me from this place because that gun is really close and i am having trouble talking myself out of this edit2 so woke up totally fine thanks everyone who talked to me last night hopefully i wont be back here anytime soon posting about my suicidal thoughts i plan on coming back to help others going through similar situations

1,nothing makes things better i am 26 years old jobless guy who didnt finish his masters degree ironically i actually completed more credits than required but i got c grades or lower in 4 subject as a result of universities policy i was dismissed without the masters degree because i dont have the degree i cant find a job asi am in a foreign country so i just stopped caring about career working etc and havent worked in like 2 years i skated by borrowing money from friends and while i paid most of it back i still got a lot of debt so i stopped talking to people at all and stopped going outside or pretty much doing anything just get up do stuff on laptop eat go to sleep and nowi amabsolutely hopelessly unable to pay rent or even buy food my mom and dad fight all the time and dad has mentally emotionally even physically abused us for years i dont ask money from them coz well i dont want to and they wont give it mom will but not dad and since dad doesnt give her any money she has to work so i cant ask her i havent told them of the terrible situation i am in i think they do care but mostly because it will make them look bad i dont find enjoyment in any of my old favorite things or any present or future stuff many of my friends have found success in jobs relationships etc but since i am so ashamed of myself i cant even talk to them not even to congratulate them no big tragedy has hit me like for example hurricane harvey wrecked houston people died they lost their house cars pets etc but i was completely unharmed by it walked around aimlessly at peak night time but no thug or junkie has ever attacked me stole my wallet phone etc stuff like that i want to end this hopeless life but i simultaneously think it is both pathetic and beyond my strength to do so dont think i will ever be able to jump in front of a car or train coz well i figure if i get hit and dont die straightaway i will be a crippled loser which i believe is worse than just loser i am so done

1,this is the most i could do firstly if you are thinking of sending help please don t as much as i admire you re noble intentions it s much too late for me i ve tried getting help it s not meant to be as the mental health services as has my doctor have concluded that i m not unwell enough based on my past achievements also i ve not decided to end my life right away but rather i ll do it after i ve tied up a few loose endsi have been doing my research and my conclusion is that for me this will be best for me i m autistic i lost both my parents i was an only child and therefore i no longer have any family i was a full time carer for my mother for 15 years she was disabled and very sick but my efforts to save her failed i completed my duties as her carer and her son but these past two years living for myself brings me no purpose no happiness no hope just loneliness and a newfound drug addiction that brings me some comfort and pleasure in my lost existencedue to my aforementioned autism i have difficulty forming relationships as if being gay wasnt difficult enough people i do meet after talking to them online like the sound of me but don t actually like me in person and so don t give me a chance i m in my early thirties and i ve never been in a relationship that has made me happy including friendships i m also living with the effects of abuse i m no longer being abused however i find myself ruminating about the past and have never truly healed from itrather than suicide i see this as an act of euthanasia the first time i tried to accomplish this task it resulted in me laying unconscious for a few days in my house that i lived alone in it may not be a natural death but to me it feels natural either existence ceases or i ll be reunited with all the loved ones i lost and we can be a family again but one things for sure this is the end of my existence that i fought to exist in to the point of exhaustioni don t know why i m posting this i suppose just so there s a record of my thoughts out there somewherethank you for reading
1,i feel likei amcrazy i feel like i have something seriously wrong with me i cant tell if its just depression and anxiety anymore i dont feel right i dont enjoy anything anymore my head feels cloudy i feel jealous of other people all the time over small trivial things i can never express how i feel when i look at my selfies i look mentally disturbed i think thats iti ama very mentally disturbed person i lack empathy i lack the ability to see things through others eyes i waste all my time away doing nothing i have no goals i feel like i have no confidence in my abilities physically i always feel awkward as if my muscle memory doesnt existi amvery noncaring towards other people my family included idk i need to see a professional i feel so powerless as if nothing in my life matters i often worry about my health wondering why i have heart palpitations all the time and why i feel like i constantly have coldallergy symptoms honestlyi amafraid to go to the doctors becausei amafraid i have cancer or some terminal i willness sometimes i worry its cancer in the brain and thats why i havent felt like myself for so long i have very little control over my thoughts i have very little control over my facial expression i just dont knowi amreligious i believe when we die we go somewhere better with that in mind i just think whats the point in living ifi ameventually just going to die anyways and in all likelihood that death will be horribly painful and gruesome life just feels likei amwaiting for that horrible terrifying moment nothing seems to matter when things do seem to matter they just dont stick i cant stop questioning my worth skill and abilities i feel like i can sympathise with people who commit mass shootings not that i would ever do something so terrible but i feel like i know how those people felt they felt useless and defeated nihilistic and jealous filled with a kind of hatred towards the world and other people not because of something other people did to them but because of the toxic feelings other peoples lives brought about within themselves they stopped caring they snapped i will never snap but i sympathize with how those killers felt the average person writes them off as crazy they werent crazy they were just mentally weakened by their own thoughts and life experiences idk this whole thing is nonsensical it feels like today there is a boulder resting on my body a metaphysical boulder that only i can see and feel 
1,welp this is the end i am such an idiot i am such a colossal idiot i had a perfect job was about to get hrt and see my fiance and i blew it i fucking blew it i took a purse out of a trashcan now the company wants me to pay it back and fired me in the process ontop of my already massive student debt i was also thoroughly humiliated through the processthis is it either tonight or tomorrowi amtaking a gun to my head and pulling the trigger i will never live this down i cant pay it back and itll probably be on my record forever so i guess this really is the end i fucking knew things were going to well i knew things were going to well for me not to fuck it up in some colossal fantastic waygoodbyei amdone this is just where it stops this stupid story has gone on far enoughi amgetting rest
1,here i go again expectations are a bitch i will tell you that just got my grades for the midterm and it fucking sucked this is my third times repeating the first year of collegei ama fuckup no other way to look at itive written down reasons for myself on why killing myself soon is better than trying to slog through lifei wont let people down anymore wont be disappointing elders and friends everyone thinksi amsmart and have what it takes but fuck that ive been stuck in the same level of college for so long all my high school classmates are going to be seniors next year and here i am stuck in first year people will always know me as that guy who got left behind when i was still in high school and middle school i was an honor student but look at me nowi ama fucking good for nothing stupid guy i wont be wasting my parents time and money on me anymore i feel like staying alive is just a waste to their money sorry for all the money theyve spent on me this fari ama good for nothing people have been trying to help me and i dont really appreciate what they do for me i mean i accept what theyre doing for me but what does it even matter fuck maybe killing myself i really the way to go people wont expect anything of me anymore and dont say it gets better thats what people expect been telling me for sometime but no r what i will always be a fuck up and you cant change that i dont know if i can even change myself expectations are a bitch i will tell you that
1,i dont know man my story is pretty pathetic ive dug myself this social hole where i literally have no one and no one will even approach me i had one good friend and she got upset with me because she didnt want to hear about my problems anymore and so i stopped bringing them up but i was struggling so much i couldnt talk to anyone and she gave up on me and hates me now i had a girlfriend and she honestly made the world light up for me and then she broke up with me and now ive got nothing left ive been on a downward spiral for over a year and i just feel so alone i have nothing going for mei amconsidered gifted but my motivation has run so dry that i can barely pass a class and i amuseless at basically any life skillsi am going no where in life and it hurts because i just need someone to be there for me i cry myself to sleep every night and no one could give less of a shit about me the only reason i havent killed myself yet is because i cant figure out a way to make it quick and painless i just want the hurting to end i dont want to cause morei dont even know what i hope to achieve by posting this i just want to shout my problems into the void so maybe someone will hear me
1,i have tried everything and plan to give up tonight is there anything i could do that i havent ive tried ketamine treatments antidepressants even went to therapy this past week yet here i am crying hanging a noose in my closet i really tried to survive is there a treatment that ive missed and would have benefitted from 
1,flashback i just looked at the knife block in my kitchen and i remembered a time when i was 11 or 12 or maybe younger but i grabbed a knife and i was holding it on myself because i wanted to die and that was when i was a kid and now i m hardly an adult and it s all making me cry
1,i am going to try to express myself honestly because i dont know where to turn right now please forgive the lengthsome context i am 19 i am a man and i am in college i have been struggling with depression social anxiety and suicidal thoughts for 3 and 34 years i have been hospitalized 3 times and been involved with some form of therapy for a large part of that time period i attempted suicide once and almost attempted quite a few times thereafter i went to college at 18 and these same feelings resulted in me losing my scholarship and being forced to transfer closer to home damni amprivileged as shiti feel likei am going insane because of how quickly i fly from a really good mood to planning my suicide these past few days have been rough with this chemistry lab that i keep missingi amalmost certain that i dont have bipolar but the thought of untreated diagnoses or of mistreated diagnoses scares the shit out of mei amalso afraid of getting involved with medicine becausei amafraid of what my parents would think since they seem to think thati am doing better even thoughi am still having similar problems as the last college i also dont want to mess with meds while my attendance at my current college is so tenuous i am on academic probation you see i wouldnt want to jeapordize the future while trying to get betteri am really lonely and meeting new people make me extremely uncomfortable i am so afraid that they would reject or ridicule me for experiencing depression and anxiety as incessantly as i do even though i recieved positive responses from everyone ive shared this with except my parents the social anxiety gets to the point where i wont leave my room unless i know my roommates arent there because i dont want them to see me and my sordid condition the fact that i am anxious makes me so upset that i think about killing myself because i dont see myself ever getting past it even though i have made considerable progress since a year ago it still feels likei am going nowhere and i know thats emotional reasoning but it still hurts so much when it feels like ive made no progressi get furious and hopelessly sad to the point of tears when i see people who are doing better than me like my roommate said i shouldnt compare my chapter 1 to what could be someone elses chapter 20 but i feel so angry at myself and everyone else when i see people who seem socially capable when i cant even look strangers in the eye on the way to class i also feel so upset when i hear people tell me that it will get better because they really dont know it could always get a lot worse and then i could finally kill myself they sound so goddamn presumptuous as if they dont know how condescending that sounds it makes me feel so broken and stupidcan i talk about how hopeless i feel i am really concerned as you might imagine i dont have a significant other i feel hopeless about ever forming that type of relationship with someone because my depression social anxiety and suicidal thoughts are things that will never go away for me and i ampretty sure that no one would want to start a relationship with someone like that so it follows that i have thoughts that i will never be able to form that kind of relationship while being honest about how i feel to that other person i feel likei ama quivering baby that no one could feel anything for but pity i feel likei ama broken egg trying to hold myself together and i ampretty sure that i have to be more secure in myself before those kinds of relationships of course the perpetual nature of my bad mental stuff leads me to believe that i will never be secure in myself and that i can never get a significant otheri knowi amyoung but ive made a lot of mustakes that make me wish i had jumped off of rhe manhattan bridge when i had the chancei am really afraid to talk to my two close friends about this because i want to respect that they have problems too i also get distorted thinking that leads me to believe that no one really cares and no one wants to hear my problems i mean in a way it is true insofar as no one wants to hear the bad news of heyi amfaring very poorly but i also understand thay theyd rather recieve that bad news than the worse news of hey your friendacquaintance temporalindifference has been found dead by suicideits just so damn hard for me to think clearly when i feel as bad about myself as i doand of course as with a lot of my type the only time i can escape any of these feelings is eheni amplaying video games masturbating listening to music or painting my wh40k figurines ei things that i can do alone and as we all know none of these are good reasons to live in themselves so i get this creeping sense of delaying my inevitable suicidei remember seeing this question on this therapy intake form that said something like how likely do you think you are to die of suicide it was a question i have never heard before and maybe i misread it i feel like my suicide is as inevitable as my depression is chronic
1,its just too much to bear anymorei am too weak for this i was not cut out for living in this existence i was never meant to be here i dont belong here i am too weak there is no place for me here my emotions are too strong for me to bear i cannot go on living like this the pain is too much i am nothing fuck everything make it end please

1,am trying to die ive written on another thread about my recent break up and i just simply cannot get past it what even is the point anymore all i can think about these days are different ways to die i get in a taxi or a bus or a train i chant to myself kill me kill me kill me i intentionally walk slowly when i cross the road i stare down buildings looking for the best way and the quickest way to end my life the only thing stopping me right now is knowing how devastated my family will be when i do it but honestly all i want to do right now is end the misery that is going on in my head today i found out my ex is on tinder barely a week after the break up we were supposed to get married we were engaged we were living together but everything is just gone just like that wow he truly cant wait to replace me am i that bad 
1,am so scared to kill myself but i see no other wayi ama 17 yo boy i always help anyone i always give everything what i have i never asked for help or anythingi am trying my best but i am still fucking useless i want to die so hard since years i have nothing to live for i hate everything and everybody nothing seriously nothing and nobody interests me i cant get excited about girls anymore human body is disgusting i just cant think about sex more it makes me sick i hate talking because everybody so fucking selfish i just stopped talking with people some years ago they ask but i know they dont really care about whati amsaying thats why my environment thinks thati ama totally okay quiet kid and they will be surprised when i kill myself i feel thati amthe worst i dont think i deserve to have relationships with other people i deserve to die slowly and painfully i hope i get cancer or something like that rarely whenever i think someone is nice and may shehe can be my friend or wtf i always think about how many other friendsgirlfriendsrelativesfamily members shehe can have and i amgetting feel myself useless because why that human want to me if they can have other friends who are definitely better than me thats why ive got nobody who loves me except my mom but i hate her because she loves me i didnt ask her to take care of me shes just making my life harder i can be dead now years ago if she didnt make me feel remorse about iti amwaiting for my mothers death so then finally i can kill myself easily i never asked for attention and i still dont want it i hate it but at least one time in my life i want to do something selfish suicide and i just cant fucking do thati am so scared about it i make plans about it every nighti ambegging for a surprise accident or whatever what can kill me just kill meactually i dont need help i dont want to get better i dont need answers i just have to tell someone what i feel so thank you i know i will kill myself by a train i just dont know when maybe today or tomorrow but i said it 2 months ago too so maybe i can survive 2017 but when i finally have one more reason for it i will do it
1,i don t really feel anything i just want to die i can t do anything i need to do and i think it s more practical to give my body back to the earth than to live on hurting it more and fighting off the inevitability of death i crack smiles and i participate in meaningless conversations with my parents and people at school but it s not me it s just the shell of the human i m keeping alive when the actual person inside me wants to die i cried when i first considered seriously killing myself again but i cried for maybe 30 seconds and then i went numb and now i m here i ve already attempted to take my life once in the year following i has motivation to live i had emotions that made me feel warm and strong and now it s all gone and i just feel like a void i m losing weight because i have no desire to eat and no motivation to get help from family or friends or medical professionals i don t even know how i d bother to kill myself because i m in such an apathetic state
1,i just tried to kill myself i tied the belt around my neck and the top of my dresser i wanted to know if i could go through with iti am too tall to fully hang so i relaxed my body and closed my eyes within a couple of seconds my arms and legs were tingling and i started to fade out my brains natural reaction was to stand up and save myself after some googling i found out that if i had waited just a couple more seconds to go unconscious i wouldve died within 20 minutes no one would know i live alone in an off campus university apartment my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me and said she just didnt want to be in a relationship right now and that down the road we could try again i know shes lyingi amoverwhelmed with university things and i can barely take care of myself at my apartment i wish i wouldve gone through with killing myself its the only solution i have to all my problems 
1,greedy cynical pathetic moody selfish asshole i am matt i am 19 years old it all stems from incest done to be my brother growing up but at this point it can t be changed my views are part of me theirs nothing for me nothing to be done or changed i have tried therapy group sessions religion but the only thing that numbs the pain is drugs and alcohol from the age of 12 i remember thinking i don t know when or how but i am going die from self inflicted suicide and it s the truth that s also around the time my substance abuse issues started i don t know why i can t let myself be happy i hate myself to the very roots i hate people and i can t stand their company i can t stand even looking anyone in the eye i can t enjoy simple things like sex or conversation or a beautiful fall day anymoreat the end of the day we our all just self righteous apes we fuck we eat we sleep and we look out for ourselves like i said i have a substance abuse problem this started from an early age marijuana was my drug of choice and i thought i was happy hell maybe i still would be if i could enjoy it but it changed on me so now i drink heavily and will use pretty much any downer i can get my hands on what bothers me the most is am with the most amazing girl i love her but yet i resent her i resent her for expecting more of me i reset her for not letting me sit in my room and play video games all day the funny thing is in my fucked up world i don t think she s good enough for me me the socially inept angry bitter retard she deserves so much better and i wish i could give her more i rely on my mom and grandparents for everything and in return i am a moody irritable asshole i have know aspirations know hope for the future the only things i really care about are my dog and cat and yet i have failed them both because they both have gum disease that i will rely on said family members to fix i often fantasize about being gunned down suffocating myself hanging myself or blowing my head off it calms me and gives me solace i hate who i am i hate the world i inhabit i hate that i treat all the amazing people around me like burdens on my back i am not meant to be here man that is all i know sorry to ramble 
1,i 16f need someone to talk to i don t feel comfortable posting the details but i think i m ready to talk to someone about it please pm me or comment if you re versed at all in the effects of rape incest sexual abuse etc don t message me if you re looking to get off on a kid being taken advantage of find your porn somewhere else i m really struggling and i can t do this alone anymore i can t stop fantasizing about ending it all right now but i know it would be a mistake
1,my last attachment is gone so why shouldnt i my best friend has stopped giving a shit about me what i thought was the closest friendship ive ever had one that would actually last for once has crumbled for no reason other thani ama sad worthless useless piece of shit its a miracle she ever cared completely i willogicalmy best friends always leave i should be used to it by now but how tf you supposed to get used to betrayal i thought this time was different i never felt so close i was actually coming out if my shell and she dropped me like the worthless sack of flesh i am and i amsupposed to what just try again like a shitty fucking video game oops game over try again next time i dont think i can anymore so someone please why tf shouldnt i she wont care noone cares i could delete myself out like a useless redunant leftover line of code and noone would miss me everything would keep running and whats the point of living the same painful 6 months over and over again hope caring and betrayal hope caring and betrayal why should anyone live through that
1,its all downhill from here long i went to one of the best high schools in my state i got okay grades made some friends and generally just tried to get through school unnoticed i was depressed for most of high school but i never had any suicidal ideations just selfharm i went to a local college where i was going to study engineering it wasnt my first choice since stem subjects arent my specialty but it was what my parents suggested so i went with it i did poorly in my first semester and had a few suicide attempts i stood on a balcony of a tenstory building several times but never got the nerve to jump when i came home for christmas my parents were mad at me for hiding my poor grades from them and i became even more depressed i stayed in bed most days during the spring semester and ended up trying to overdose in april i panicked and called 911 ending up in a psychiatric hospital it was a shitty place and i hope to never go there again my parents found out about my suicide attempt and i told them about my depression so they decided to send me to a therapistpsychiatrist they werent very helpful but i got some meds that at least helped me get out of bed i went back to school in the fall for accounting which my counselor recommended i try after taking an aptitude test school went just as poorly as it had previously though and it was a repeat of last years christmas break i went back to school in the spring but did poorly again this summer i got a customer service job and dropped out of college ever since ive been lying to my friends and convincing themi am still at college even though they never see me on campusif you bothered to read that whole story youve probably noticed a pattern in my life of things getting worse i was always told i could do great things but here i am at 20 going to work at a grocery store at 5 am i dont see my life getting better from here so i only see two possible futures one is where i live out the rest of my life working crappy jobs and leeching off of other people i disappoint everyone around me for decades until eventually i die miserable and alone alternately i kill myself now those closest to me will probably suffer a bit mourn for a little while but eventually theyll move on their lives will continue without me as a burden on them i will be free from worrying about the future and having to deal with my mistakes one of these futures is much more enticing than the other and i amrunning out of reasons not to choose the latter just looking for some outside opinions on what i should dotldr my life is awful and its easier to die now than live in suffering for decades so why not just end it

1,18002738255 i have this number memorized by heart as if it were a part of me i dial it and sit there thinking phone in one hand and knife in the other my girlfriend whos still with me said out of the blue last night while were talking and joking that were two different people and she cant picture us being together i then told her to think about the fact that she loved me and she asked but do i i told her shes the only one i want and i wont give up and she proceeds to ask but are you the one i want half an hour later she says she loves me then 15 mins after that she said dont try to change just because she doesnt picture us togetheri amsitting here with my best friends knife and hotline youd love them they kill me i dont know if this is my last words and my goodbye to this world but i might as well leave some form of record if it is
1,i read something here the other night and i amafraid it inspired me first time posting 20somethingfi amthe first person to sayi am not suicidal but man am i depressed and feel better off dead i read a post i found in the depths somewhere the other night it was from a train operator requesting people not kill themselves by means of the railroad because of the trauma it inflicts on the operator while i understand that this post finally gave me what i was a looking for how i can surely end my lifei have been struggling for normality and comfort in my life for quite sometime after my life suddenly crumbled to a pile of constant spontaneous combustioni am not really sure where to begin there if someone asks i will share but i could honestly write a book as the world turns in my universe and people would think i was a good writer ive been seeing a psychologist for almost 3 years now she is very helpful but she cant change my chemical imbalance and she certainly cant fix the shithole that is my life i am scared now though because it is sinking in more and more that this is who i am for life i currently live with a railroad in my backyard i literally mean it would take all of 30 seconds to be on the tracks and dead once i heard or saw a train the fantasy of this is so fucking freeing but dont even get started on the nightmare of its reality tldr i am pretty confident i wont lay down on the railroad tracks or kill myself at all but i have fallen in love with the idea of doing so 
1,i just want to die i cant take this life i just cant every problem in my entire life all leads back to because i had to be born male why why did i have to have my life ruined like this i will never get to transition and even if i could i would never pass and no male would ever want to date me no one would want to be my friend because id be referred to as some freak or faggot because the world is a fucked place i cant do anything at all about it its all so hopeless all i can do is stay in bed all day and stay high so the suicidal thoughts arent as bad i can just feel sorry for myself and thats it no one cares about me and thats because i had to be born male i could make people like me i wouldnt be so boring if i couldve just been born in the correct gender i just want to die theres no hope and i am tired of suffering please just make it end please

1,am really concerned about my boyfriend weve both midteens been dating for around a year and hes been struggling with mental i willness and social issues and isolation almost his entire life hes talked to me about his past traumas and suicide attempts and ive tried to make sure he feels heard and understood sometimes hed get really drunk and high and tell me about when hes planning to kill himself it had been in spring then summer hes told me hes only stuck around so he wouldnt fuck me up but very recently hes relapsed with self harm and been very quiet and withdrawni am really worried about him hes so much more valuable than he knows hes been diagnosed with several mental i willnesses including depression generalized anxiety adhd and some type of schizophrenia recently his hallucinations have been getting worse he is not receiving proper treatment every time he and his parent go to a therapist they put him on the same medication that does nothing to help him because hes at risk for addiction so they give him the least a usable medication so he stops taking it after a few months and goes back to self medication with recreational drugs and alcohol i really do believe hes trying to do the best he can a lot of the time and recreational drugs are the closest he can get to what he needs after most of our mutual friends moved away hes been really alone and i amworried thats worsening things for him i try to tell him how much i love him and how even though he might not see it that hes smart and loving and valuablei am trying to be there for him but i amworriedi am not doing enough or being smothering what can i do to help him id do anything to make him feel better thank you

1,its just so funny i can post on and get no responses no upvotes at all but plenty of views i post here sayingi amgonna end it all and all of a sudden theres an outpouring of support and people telling me to contact them if i need to saying i need to reach out and get help etc etc etc and its the same shit offline too you tell someone youre depressed and sad and its like yeah okay but when are you but as soon as you say you wanna kill yourself people suddenly care its all for selfish reasons too no one wants to be the one who ignored a suicidal person but its fine to brush off someone before they get to that point like yall do realize that feeling alone and helpless is what pushes people to that point right
1,not yet some day maybe first time posting life has hit a dead end and honestlyi amdisappointed with myself and everything i feel like everything and everyone that once made me happy are fading soon i will be an unfeeling husk i dont want that id rather die than exist without any feeling or meaningi amjustteetering on the edge

1,nothing will ever be ok its too late for me to make any lasting changes or recover in school for my dream job and everything one after the other has gone wrong its too late to fix anything was it worth taking a shot absolutely is it worth it to continue 
1,first time having suicidal thoughts my depression started when i realized what was happening with me during my childhoodhighschool period my parents were always treating me as if i m not capable of doing things or useless thinking they are doing good thing to me they would presume that i was going to fail or trying to do the work for me to this day they still treat me like i m useless piece of shit and because of that i had never really tried anything to do to prove them wrong because i dont want to prove anyone wrong about something like that recently i ve passed my last exam on my uni i was doing a project in a programing language an online shop my mother was angry on my brother because he didnt do the project for me when she heard i passed she couldnt believe it i have no motivation to be good at anything ive been brought down so many times i feel likei amalone in this and its really hard when your closest cant give you support you need they dont trust me and my skills they keep reminding me of my homework or anything that i have to do because they think i m unable to do it by myself to be responsible for something the moment i passed my last exam i felt huge depression because i expected atleast from my closest a littlebit of faith in me i proved them wrong and that i m capable of doing something right but i dont care about that as i already said i want to prove to myself and i find my parents attitude extremely distracting and demotivatingi am too scared of failing anymore i feel like i wouldnt take it good if i failed i have no selfesteem no faith in myself this wouldnt bother me so much if i wasnt actually capable of doing well payed things like programing suicide came across my mind because i m scared of ending up with minimal wage job with all the wasted potential i think i would kill myself if i end up like that i ve spent my whole life thinking that everyone else was better than me 
1,amjust so tired ive been suicidal for a little over a decade everyday i think about killing myself without fail obviously on good daysweeks i hear that thought in my head and just shrug it off but the bad daysjust keep piling on and keep getting worse and worseim just tired tired of everything tired of continuing life because its selfish of me to end it how is it selfish of me to want this pain ive been feeling for the majority of my life to stop but not selfish of to condemn me for feeling this way because dont want me to diei cant handle this right now any of this and i just feel like everything is closing in on me this strange feeling that my life is coming to a close soon i try to try and let it all out but no matter what i can only muster up a few tears after years of suppressing emotions and tears and sadness i think i broke myself and i think the end is in sightall i ever wanted was to feel happy 
1,my only reason to live is to not hurt others with my own death i don t really know where else to turn about this i ve been suicidal for years now and i m tired of people telling me that it s going to get better when the sad thing is that things haven t and things don t appear able to improve in the future honestly in most of my life situations it just seems like god is a cruel little kid who builds me up for excitement only to follow it up with extreme disappointment and sadness sometimes within the hour it s starting to feel really fucked up i just want a win for once in my life it dawned on me last night that the only reason for me to not go ahead and just end my life is the effect it would have on my family which means my only purpose is to just exist in pain and not cause any to others i don t want to hurt my mom with my death but i really don t think i can do this for much longer i know this all sounds so selfish but i m just looking for a reason to live has anyone else felt this way before how did you overcome it what have you found to give you purpose and not fall into the void
1,meet them where they are here is one of the few safe places that people can come and talk openly about suicide without judgement and in theory without eliciting an immediate emotional response that blocks that person from expressing their feelingsthe responses here are obviously going to be different to the responses that would be received by or made by the people that come here in real life in a non professional face to face settingi would be the first to admit that if i suffered a tragedy tomorrow i wouldnt be in the best place to be here and be presentand thats exactly the point its the realisation that its not that simple as thinking count yourself lucky because oh my you dont think that people destroy themselves that they cant think like that that they dont scream at themselves to stop feeling the way that they dohere it is safe and we meet them where they are we join them in their despair even with the knowledge that we may not be able to make anything better but offering that space and time may be the one thing that is needed and that nobody else has ever done for themit is in fact a very precious thing to be able to offer yourself to just be with somebody else and fully present to themamy
1,i wanna just kill myselfi am so tired of life the only thing that keeps me going are small things like video games food and enjoying laying in bed i dont want that to end and thats it everything else doesnt mean shit because i dont have anyone maybe a few friends but they dont understand depression or anything and they dont help at all i guess they would care if i killed myself but so many people say that and i feel like its only because they feel bad and want to cheer me up or something but it doesnt i have tried to kill myself before but i made sure i was only hospitalized because it was a cry for help so people would take me seriously yet people still dont but when i do kill myself people will all miss me and act like they cared and tried to help right i hate school too ive failed 9th grade twice and i amfucking stupid and i cant take it teachers treat me like garbage because they know ive failed twice and overall lowers my already non existant self esteem i hate how i look and how my body is its never as good as any other guys i dont have abs or anything special at all girls barely even acknowledge i exist and girls who i have dated either cheated on me or left leaving me to think they just felt bad for me my family treats me like a disappointment too i dont wanna drop out but i feel like i have to or else i will be in high school forever sorry if this isnt that organized just needed to rant or something because i cant handle this for much longer 
1,please tell me what is wrong with me i know i already have a lot of obvious problems like my appearance my weight my race my sexuality my intelligence and my lack of talent or skill but is there something deeper wrong with me when i tell my mom i love her she always likes to say you dont love me you just love what i do for youshes been saying that for a long time and shes right of coursei am21 with no job no high school education and i sit on my ass all day doing nothing while she works but i dont know if i actually dont love her i dont know if i love anyonei became more curious about this today when i was talking with a friend and he said he doesnt think i will ever be happy and that i dont care about anything he knows me pretty well so hes probably right also but i dont want to end up like that i dont think i have a choice thougheven though i knowi am so fucked up and worthless and everythingi amnever going to do anything about it i dont even shower or brush my teeth or anything i dont clean or cook maybe i just dont give a shit about anything maybei amincapable of truly loving anyone maybe i should just dieits stupid of me the post this and none of you will have a magic solution i doubt anyone will even read all of this and reply but i guess it makes me feel a bit better to do it
1,can someone just talk to me i just want to connect and then i will be ok
1,suicide may be a permanent solution but 1 it is a solution and 2i am not looking for temporary solutions i resent that saying so much permanent solution to a temporary problem ugh
1,a window into my life i guess this was an email i sent to someone last night typos probably depression anxiety being alone not truly being needed by anyone here it sucks it hurts no one needs me herei amjust here for the sole purpose of existing no one would care or notice if i disappeared tonight no one bothers to ask me howi am doing today no one stops to ask me ifi am doing okay everyone has a group of friends who love them endlessly and actually want to see them outside of school and talk to them and everythingi amjust a background decoration in everyones lives and all i need is to just be validated all i ever wanted was to feel wanted this life is literal hell its my personal hell id rather be anywhere but here id rather be anyone else but me i dont want this body i dont want this life maybe if i go people will notice no one fucking talks to me unless they need me to listen to their problems and god i want to help but it sucks thati amjust a personal therapist to everyone just once id like someone to text me like hey how are you feeling today or a message like you matter to me and i need you here no one fucking cares people say they do but no one fucking listens to me when i text them asking for help my insides are crying save me now fuck this life fuck this world i dont want to be me i feel so fucking alonei am so sick of waking up every single day and wishing i didnt i am sick of crying so much i cant fucking stand being such an outcast all i ever fucking wanted was to fit in i hate myself more than words could ever fucking describe and i just want to blow my face to goddamn bits with a shotgun i feel so goddamn bad that you have to read this shit because its not easy to hear these kind of words i hate that i care about everyone so goddamn much i wish i could stop when everyone else wakes up their nightmares end mine never does everyday i pray that i will wake up from this dream and be a happy beautiful child who is loved by everyone this mental i willness is tearing me up right in front of everyones eyes and no one cares i talk about killing myself a lot and i bet if i were to be in the middle of killing myself no one would stop me ive been depressed since i was a child wanna know what fucking sucks about teen depression while everyone is living the best years of their life by going to parties making awesome memories falling in love and so oni am noti amwishing my own fucking life awayi amscared that i will just be thrown into a hospital again and be put on meds that just make me feel so damn numb i am so ready to go i dont want to be here anymore everyday is a battle with myself its like going to war with the enemy and each battle ends in your bitter defeat but you still show up on the battle field every day even though you know youre going to get your ass kicked each day the wounds become deeper and more severe you grow weaker and weaker and then one day you wave a white flag and its over or the enemy finally kills you either way you will lose to your demons i have accepted the fact that my demons will win and fuck maybe they already havei am tired of fighting 
1,i dont really understand hi i just felt like posting my thoughts somewhere sincei amfeeling a bit down and a tad bit introspective ive decided to share a bit of my life with the internet which i know isnt exactly the smartest thing but heyi amhere might as wellokay so ive been suicidal and depressed on and off for a couple of years now i cant exactly tell you when it started since problems like this usually stem from childhood issues but i can say that it certainly started getting worse sometime around grade seven or eight now ive been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder ocd and severe depression but i am not currently seeing any therapist due to my parents disbelief in mental i willness i think that they might not want to believe that their daughter has any type of problem at all or maybe this all ties into their general ignorance of things i dont hate my parents but i dont really believe in their values theyre racist homophobic my dad is sexist and my mother uses religion to justify everything she does okay back to me like i said i have a couple of mental issues with my depression and ocd probably being the worst of the bunch my ocd is very very disruptive of daily lifei am not particularly religious but i am not an atheist i am a 16 soon to be 17 year old girl and my sexuality is homosexual though i dont like the term lesbian very much due to its oversexualized connotation i like pretty boring stuff like writing reading and drawingi amparticularly interested in writing and i would like to become an author and hopefully slow down the death process of modern literature yeahi ama stud arent i i have relationship issues with my girlfriend but i wont get into that hereright now in a general reference to daily life i feel nothing nothing i can particularly say my emotions are somewhat normal if a bit exaggerated in the moment but on an overarching scale i feel fairly empty even so ive been thinking about killing myself i used to think that i gave up cutting after having a little dispute with my mother over the scabbylines on my wrist its been about two years since then and ive started cutting up my thighs on an almost daily basisi am not like one of those edgy teens where i cut because of the physical pain distracts from the emotional pain i think its simply because of the dopamine reward my brain gives me for doing something good ive just always had a slightly high pain tolerance and i find myself attracted to the pair of sharpened scissors hiding away in my desk drawer last night though i had used a different pair they were the closest thing to me at the time and i ended up cutting myself a nice little and by little i mean huge gash right across my thigh i almost thought i needed stitches for a second i remember the initial spark of pain and then there was nothing it wasnt the numbness of a severed nerve no it just didnt i pressed down on it to stop the bleeding no pain i could feel myself pressing down but it just wasnt accompanied by any pain it was an almost surreal experience for me thats got me thinking i havent killed myself out of fear for the pain since i live in canada with no guns and i have no access to tall buildings and i dont own a car or have access to any potentially lethal pills the only viable method of killing myself that i have are the knives in my kitchen i had held one against the throat in the past but never had the guts to bring it down i have imagined stabbing myself in the stomach on multiple occasions but could never actually pull a knife that leads me to wonder about slitting my wrists ive heard of how painful it is but right now i cant really find myself caring i dont particularly care about anything at all school is easy i have nineties in every class and i havent studied a single day in my life i dont ever have any homework to worry about because i finish it all in class with time to spare i have enough friends to satisfy me and a girlfriend to keep me occupied romantically though i cant really comprehend sexual or romantic attraction so its more or less another form companionship to me and other than my earlier sediments on my parents i dont have a particularly bad home life my career as an author and english teacher is but a givenin fact for other people i might have an amazing life i just cant what phrase would be correct here comprehend yeah i guess i just cant the meaning of life sure i can understand the complex inner workings of society and the average human psyche my marks in social studies and psychology prove just that i just find myself unable to understand simple things why is that person happy why is society working away like sheep why am i who i amam i even who i amwho am ii amright then why does it sound so foreign to me why does my body feel like its not actually there i will look at objects pets or people in my life and wonder how they have been there my entire life they look so new and foreign to me i cant understand them in the slightest if i cant understand living then how am i supposed to live am i a sociopath or am i a normal human being simply going through a phase of introspection while my brain is developing into that of an adults could this be some kind of side effect of constantly reading and writing or is there something very very wrong with mei cant understand life so i want to die i cant understand death either so does that mean i have nowhere to turn to then it comes down to the original question should i kill myselfi amim kinda leaning towards a yes here i dont really know how to end something like this honestly i would be surprised if anyone even made it this far thank you for reading my little tale and let me tell you that each and every word here is true these words come from the very bottom of my souli really dont understand anything do i 
1,if you dont know that it might get better why do you insist on staying i saw this too many times everyone is saying to stay but even you dont have hope that it will get better theres even a policy on this subreddit not to do that wishful thinkingso why prolong the inevitable
1,even when things are going relatively well i would rather just not livei am20 years old and a couple courses away from a community college diploma in accounting which can be transferred to give me half of the credits for a bachelorsi was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when i was about 13 but i never went on medicationi have had good times and bad times over the past few years it seems that recently the bad times have been getting more frequentsome courses in school give me no problem at all i aced things like financial accounting but if i have to write anything i will probably failfrom the time i was 9 i remember struggling to write stories in class now days tell me to write a memo essay or even something short and i just cant do it i have tried dictating it but that doesnt help i feel i just dont have the ideas in my head to put on paper even when i had to write physics lab reports i found it impossibledue to this i dont think i will ever be able to finish university and i cant handle working somewhere like a grocery store for my whole lifei amfrom canada but this yeari amspending a year abroad in belgium as an au pair i met my girlfriend in a community jazz band while she was taking a gap year in canada and i followed her back to belgium about a month ago she is so amazing and probably the one thing keeping me from falling into a deep depression and seriously considering suicide right nowi have one day a week totally free and i basically slept the whole day i should be exploring belgium 0 or at least go for a walk down the street i talked to my girlfriend and she has been supportive and is trying to help me get out of the house but i find it impossible some days are okay yesterday i went to audition for a choir and it went fairly well she is a very motivated person and i amscared that me doing nothing could pull us aparti also start things with a great deal of motivation but it typically fades quickly and i want to quit this happens with things like school sports work and any other type of activity really it happens even if it is something i really like i just find it hard to drag myself to iti need to figure out how to finish school i need to figure out how to stay motivated be able to tolerate my job and stop being such a negative person all the timeright nowi am really freaked out because i dont know how i can get through all of this i dont know what i will do with my life i have this year to figure things out then i have to go back to canada we did a few months already but a long distance relationship will be its own challenge and face reality i can stay with my mom as long as i am going to school i am thinking maybe i should push through the 3 courses and get my diploma as a checkpoint i was just going to go to university and go straight for my bachelors as i still get the transfer credits but i dont have a clue what i should do after that i think i should probably talk to a professional again i most likely shouldnt wait untili amback in canada but doing it here in belgium is intimidatingthanks

1,i try so hard but even i know thats a lie i dont know whats wrong with me anymore i pissed away so many good things in my life because of what i feel was one persons fault and ive been dragging that ball and chain behind me for years nowi cant find the motivation to change who i am or the situation ive put myself into been homeless lived in the bed of my truck kicked out of countless houses becausei ama terrible employee and cant keep a job i quit my tractor trailer driving job because i didnt want to be away from my family but now thati amhome i cant muster the strength to look them in the face anymorei was always late on rent because i just cant control my money and nowi amsquatting in a run down house with holes in the roof walls and ceiling no plumbing and the only electricity is a drop cord from the neighbors house its just been me and my cats for years going from town to town job to job house to house i feel likei amat the point where ive become such a burden on everyone around me that i cant ask for help because it seems likei amalways leeching off everyone i sleep until i absolutely have to wake up for work because i dont even want to be awake anymore but i amwriting this now because i had a thought to myself that if i were to just off myself now no one would notice for weeks maybe months despite everyone knows where i am because no one cares to visit to call or just acknowledge my existence and i dont blame them
1,since july 29th this year ive been thinking about suicide and that i will do it this year still havent gone to it but will probably do it before christmas i didnt know when it started but about 45 years ago i started to hate myself a lot my first suicide attempt was when my parents fought i just grabbed a knife to stop them from fighting saying that i will kill myself yesi amhorrible but i actually wanted to kill myself that time they asked me whats wrong i answered that i didnt know but i actually know that i hate myself after that my mom kept telling her friends about that as if i cant hear it i never attempted suicide after that but i can still feel the depression and selfhate slipping in then this year happened i almost left home but my parents stopped me and i told them what i actually feel inside i told them that i hate myself and i just kept scratching on my arms i told them i have mental health issues then a week later i accidentally pushed my cousin was pissed off and my parents scolded me i whispered something about my mental health issue and how it couldve affected my thinking but my parents didnt believe me i had a fucking mental breakdown in front of them and yet they think thati am still joking now my mom said something about us being a perfect family since theyre not like those other parents out there who doesnt care about their children and she told me that theyre not the problem i am like for the past 5 years ive known that i am the problem i have a problem i actually thought that they would at least help me but they shrugged me offi ama covert narcissist and i hate that i wanted to change but i cant i cant i cant do this alone thats why i told my parents everything ive felt but i actually dont trust them anymore i dont want to talk to them about my feelings i dont need them to understand i just need them to listen but i could already see that they wont i can see iti amplanning on leaving suicide notes on this laptop and various other placesi amalso hinting on facebook about it i just wanted my parents to save me but i guess they cant i will just save myself from this misery
1,i cut myself again for the sixth time in four weeks ive been sobbing into my pillow for the last ten minutes because of it and everything else in my life i wish the people in my life actually understood what depression is actually like among other things i just want out why did you start cutting yourself make sure you keep it clean getting an infection would suck many people cant really handle the concept of suicide i think society is messed up but this subreddit can help at least a bit 
1,whats the easiest way to commit suicide painless and simple
1,thinking about giving up so i really screwed myself i am going to completely fail a class i cant drop i have tried moving heaven and earth to get out of this class but nothing can be done i feel like ive ruined my futurei amsupposed to be transferring soon but i think thats all over ive essentially lived for my gpa it was one of the only things keeping me going but nowi am so lost i want to end it all even though i know its stupid and selfish i cant talk to anyone about this and its eating me alive i dont know how long i can keep going anymore i just want to sleep forever
1,didnt hang myself because i got spooked out i just think its best for me to go why is even suicide this hard ive just got home from going out to kill myself i had scouted my area for places to hang myself for weeks now and thought i found an adequate spot now so i went there past 2am with my rope to end this misery but upon arriving ive noticed that the path leading to the place i was heading to was not lit by street lamps already gave me a bad vibe but okay time to turn on the torchlight on my phone after a few metres in i got spooked really bad by a tree i mistook for some slendermanesque man and after catching my breath by some animal in the bushes that was to much for me so i went back home everything seemed so unreal like a real life psychedelic horror movie until i got back homei ama bit dissappointed with myself as killing myself would be the best way out of my misery but its not really easy if the sorrow and neuroticism that consumes you transfers into your suicide plans and makes you fear failure to off yourself on the first tryi am not even depressed or feeling sad right nowi am in a pretty neutral state of mind but thinking about myself suicide seems like the logical thing to do i will now read into death by exsanguination as for my bathroom is lit even at night

1,amsick of feeling like my feelings arent real unless theyre experienced in a certain way so maybe killing myself will convince me that i really am sufferingeven ifi am not really suicidal dont know i just wish i was someone else and i know no one will give a shit about that theyll just say be yourself and leave it at that because obviously your persona that annoys people isnt going to cause problems because people will accept you for who you are for some reasonthis life is pointless after all i dont do anything i have no motivation no confidence nothing i dont know why i manage to go onmaybe it doesnt matter if whati amexperiencing is real or not but then id have no reason to do this or maybe it doesnt matter to have a reason jesus i can never keep things consistent in my mind maybe this would be a good thing even if it would hurt everyonewhats the point in trying if i lack to strength to do whatever i want without worrying about being judged or failingi wish i was a guy and i cant even convince myselfi amtransgender because i dont experience it like most of them do i dont have fucking gender dysphoriai amdeluding myself yet id bother killing myself over itwhy am i so dramatici am not cringing irl i just feelempty is that the right wordbut if i did feel a bit more id be cringingmehi still have some life in me i could bother saving myself but i dont feel like it now is the perfect opportunity to justdo somethingabout iti act like an annoying main character in a book i use i too much i feel different from everyone else and focus on it so much that i fail to see how my feelings are legitimate and i whine too much about it i just want people to feel bad for me i want to show themi amsuffering that my life sucks thati am really this great special person that everyone should love because i have no bad intentions yet i troll my own friends when i feel jealousthe wanting sympathy part honestly its probably another reason for the impostor syndrome shitbecause i am faking it somewhatmaybe feeling likei amfaking it is fake too likei am doing that for attention i knowi amposting on reddit for attention i knowi amkilling myself for attention everything is just a cry for help i annoy friends i hardly talk to them about this sort of shit anymore because i feel likei amsuch a burden for them so i go to reddit and i literally post shitty things to strangers and expect sympathy obviously i dont always get it ive used multiple accounts ive acted far too dramatic ive basically been a stupid little bitch bitch doesnt even feel like a good word for mei ampractically the opposite of a slut i purposely make myself look ugly to rebel against the shitty way society views women theyre sex toys with thin revealing clothing with too much makeup and they have to shave in places where men dont have to fuck thati need to end it i dont want to keep going in circles i just want to forget about everything and not have to be reminded by my own brain about all the crappy things ive done the shitty event in my life which might be considered traumatic as i ironically feel a lot worse over it than the day my mom died but its all selfinflicted but no one will fucking get it and if i dare talk about it my identity is at risk of being exposed even though i wasnt that popularim not really suicidal amjust selfishwho gives a shiti meani amdepressed right but i havent even seen a therapist so how the fuck do i know if part of that isnt made up toowait why am i calling part of it realprobably because i know i have somethingits just not legit anymorei dont know if i will actually do it maybe i will maybe i wont like most times where i didnt i felt too shitty and lazy to do homework and i will fail my math test tomorrow and i dont knowi dont want to see the light anymore and convince myself not to dieisnt that wonderful not really but it sounds incredibly stupidlike againi ammaking this all up because i like feeling the pain otherwise i wouldve taken steps to improve my moodlike getting enough sleep and eating healthily and shitim not suicidal why am i doing thisfuck everythingi may or may not do this maybe i will just chicken out becausei ama loser i dont knowi think reincarnation exists though so maybe i will be able to try againi hope i wont fuck it upmy name is victoria and i ama confused selfish dramatic loser at least if i did this it would be the last time i hurt people even if it hits them hard it would be the last and theyd get over it

1,reincarnation sounds amazing the idea of a restart just by killing myself is too tempting i keep hearing stories that if you die and you get a restart what i would give to restart my whole life knowing whats going to happen to meeven if it isnt true death would better than my life now i was bullied for 10 years where i was pushed around and called names and all the effort i put into my studies and club which resulted in average grades and a meaningless certificate i lied to people that i had good grades before because it hurt admitting that there were nights i stayed up studying weeks before my major exams and it meant nothingi finally got out of that shit hole and i wasted my chances people kept complimenting me and i got arrogant and my short temper got the best of me my first friend i made in my new school was amazing she was there whenever i felt down and there for me when people pushed me around but she couldnt stand my attitude everyone kept warning me but only until i lost my friend did i realise what an asshole i amif i jump the pain would end at worst and at best i get another shot to make things right
1,my note is always bad and wrong just like me this fucking note just never sounds authentic and i dont know what advice to put after my death like wills what to do with my body song to play at my funeral and stuff like that i cant even put what i feel into words so is anyone ever going to forgive me but i cant live in agony been to councilling but it tells you things are difficult just power through them and thats it i mean its good for some just not me ive been told i will always feel like this ive just got to cope but i cant cope kill me
1,people say things get better but its not likei amever going to stop hating myselfi amsure that any problem i have with college trying to find a job or relationships is temporary but i hate myself and i always have i hate this depression i hate how ugly i am i hate how shy i am i hate how scared of everything i am i hate the random rage fits i have theres nothing that i like about myself and why should i expect that to change i cant just get rid of all these flaws theyre all part of me i hate myself more than anything on this planet every day i imagine taking a bunch of pills and oding but i dont have any to do it withi genuinely cant see why people like me like i have close friends who really like me and i have no idea why i suck

1,i literally dont know i cant explain whati amfeeling to anyone its the usual i have few friends none of them care about me i have a terrible family i have no motivation to do anything at all closeted gay in a homophobic environment obese and unattractive but i dont get it these things are all common i knowi am not the only depressed person in the world but i know that i dont relate or feel like any of them ive never been passionate about anything more than just dying i feel like i dont even want it to get better likei amliterally lusting over dying but i am too much of a pussy to do it ive really tried talking to people but i amaware of how much bullshit is passed on just to make people realize they dont actually wanna die which is true for some people but is it possible to be in a situation where death is the only option i just really really hate the idea of being alive and i am not even kidding the only thing keeping me alive is not being able to do the actual deed not because i dont want to but becausei amscared of it i feel like i have plenty of reasons to be depressed yet none of them are what makes me want to be dead it feels likei amjust not meant to be alive in some way and its soo hard to explain this without sounding weird idek whyi amwriting this guess i needed to vent
1,i want to be in pain sometimes my hands shake and i just want to smash them with a hammer i talk to myself so much but i dont really ever have anything nice to say to myself but i still feel likei ama better friend to myself than anyone else will ever be is there someone out there for me sometimes i really hope not i always convince myself thati ambest alone any time spent on me is time wasted i just want to diei amsure people would barely notice or care it seems that when people say they feel bad that someone they knew maybe at school or work kills themself its more selfish than theyd ever admit does anyone really care about my life or do they just care about the uniform routine of their own i feel like everyone would be more sad that now something is different people dont like change but a lot of people dont like me either so maybe my death would be a good change the kind that everyone wants in their life sometimes you want to become rich maybe famous maybe you just want to meet that special someone you just want to be happy you want your life to change in a good way i feel like everyone around me could only ever be happy if i died slowly and painfully maybei amtheir good change not my life but my death

1,i feel too much all the fucking time i have had debilitating anxiety and ocd since i was a kid at one point it became so overwhelming i fell into a horrible depression and tried to commit suicide years later i am no longer depressed at least i dont believe so but very often still want to kill myself part of it is my ocd some of my intrusive thoughts are suicide based but a lot of it comes from the fact that the anxiety and ocd entirely rule my life i cant get through college because i cant turn in papers and i cant navigate certain social situations because i cant seem to talk everything is too overwhelming with no perceivable future and the shame that comes along with that i just find myself wondering all the time if it would just be easier just not to exist anymore 
1,running out of ideas i feel like my entire life has just been distractions and procrastinating until one day i will run out of ways to put off suicidei amsick of saying i will just wait one more day i dont want to try anymorei am so exhausted i cant remember a time before i was depressed there has always been something wrong with me i wish i could rely on someone else for a few moments but i am too much of a burden to carry i ruin everything i touch and have no future i cant keep doing this

1,suicide option is liberating i know this sounds odd but it was so liberating when i determined that suicide was a realistic option for me now if i lose my job rather than trudge through the public embarrassment of losing my home and my family have to give up the cushy lifestyle we have now or making them move to a strange city there is a plan b suicide i kill myself and my family gets an instant financial windfall more than i could provide in 10 years so this realization has freed me up nowi amlike fuck it i started my own business on the side because if it fails who cares at worst i kill myself which is an option at best i am successful and can make my wife and kids proud of me knowing that i can always kill myself has also freed me up in how i deal with people too ive cut my abusive father out of my life because well why not if all goes to shit because i cut him out i just pull the plug and end itodd way to look at it but knowing that the worst thing that can happen is i die has liberated me in a way that nothing else has not thati amencouraging anyone to commit suicide get help your life is worth living even if mine one day wont be
1,been a while trigger i use to vent on here and the depression r reddit alot and for some reason id get alot of rude people commenting on my post but anyways i cant say that things have improved i had a rough time with the system when i started counseling last year i believe i dont know my mind is hazyi had two horrendous experiences with my first two counselors and during this my father got sick and passed away then i was told that i couldnt go there for counseling anymorelater on my significant other left me and i suffered until i reconnected with my close friend again and they helped me seek counseling but during this i got involved with someone who was bad for my mental health and i ended up overdosing again a few timesmy friend was supportive at first but they seemed to have burned out and i amunsure if my current counselor really cares about helping mei dont really have much faith in the system after everything that ive been through
1,amjust apathetic whats the point of being herei amjust here to make other people happy so long story short i had a boyfriend that i was crazy about i was actually happy for once in my life and felt like life had purpose we broke up after a year and a half about two months ago he told me that he wanted to marry me he almost proposed hes now dating another girl for a month now and has told her he loves her and wants to marry her i am not naive to think he really loves her the idiot just cant tell the difference between love and infatuation regardless hes still a happy idiot and i ammiserablesoi am going through the process of grieving i went crazy and was very close to killing myself the only reason i didnt is because of my familyi amgetting better ive had moments where ive accepted it and am ready to move on but the thing is i think this is the besti amgonna be until i find someone else like this is basically how i was before i met him just pretty apathetic about lifei amstarting to make friends and trying to better myself but for what so i can force myself to tolerate this life so i dont kill myself to keep other people happyi am in law school and i am trying to focus on the material and do the readings but i amfalling behind because i just dont care anymore i have to force myself to do this so i can get a job to support myself one day so i can tolerate this life sweetyeah maybe i will meet someone else one day that makes me feel happy like my ex did but what happens when he leaves too like my ex almost proposed to me everyone in my family loved him i thought everything was great between us then bam hes fallen out of love with me like fuck how am i supposed to trust after that and whats shittier is that i still miss him i tell myself over and over that i dont but i do i would probably take him back even though i tell myself over and over that i wouldnt or what if i never meet someone that makes me feel that way again thats whati ammost afraid of if i wanted to be in a relationship again i could just none of the guys have had that spark that i had with my ex i dont know what that spark is but i amaddicted to it like i literally could never get tired of being around my ex like i almost wish i was the kind of person who needed some space because i probably wouldnt be so fucked in the head but i could literally spend every moment with that person and feel happy of course theres fights and its not always roses but even the shitty times with him are better than these apathetic moments life felt like it had purpose now it feels like theres no point now its just me surviving and putting on a smile so other people arent sad which i mean i get it itd be selfish of me to trade my apathy for their sadness but this isnt fulfilling this is just being another number in the world i wish i just never existed that way no one could be sad over me because they never would have known me and i wouldnt hurt because i never would have known what life is i wish i wouldnt have screwed things up with him yeah he didnt buy me presents or do things that i wanted to do and thats shitty that makes me a pushover and pathetic but i was still happier being a pushover than i am for trying to have standards for myself we arent going to talk ever again we arent friends on facebook anymore and he blocked me on instagram the only communication i have left with him is just seeing his name pop up on the list of people who have viewed my snapchat story and you know how pathetic i am it makes my whole day when i see his name there its why i go out and try to have a life so i can post pictures on there and so hell see them and then i feel depressed until hes looked at it its pathetic and sad but thats what i am 
1,anything is there anything i could take or do i wish there was something i could take where i felt no pain just take it and go to sleepi amsuch a coward i know but man it would so much easier
1,not a goodbye just an acknowledgement hello i am relatively new to reddit and its a bit sad to say its because of this subreddit i have finally decided to become an active user not in the sense that this subrredit led me to becoming suicidal more in the sense that ive come to this website more and more to escape from my life and today was the culmination of all of it because ive found a place where i dont have to lie or pretend to be someonei am noti ama compulsive liar i suspect that is so because i want to retain a sense of control over my life but that is a topic for another time i still dont feel comfortable enough to post my own story here not that i dont trust the people here its just difficult for me posting something so personal somewhere so public which i know is paradoxical because its a public anonimity and everyones intention here is to help or to seek out helpfor themselves but still i have a hard time showing my own wounds to anyone but me in the mirror that sounded really cringy sorry about that what i really wanted to do in this post is to commend everyone that put time away just so they could help others that are going through similar situations the energy you guys dispense is your own you are sharing these beautiful sincere and absolutely touching messages of togetherness and understanding that you can hear these scattered individuals silent screams and that they sound unfortunately familiar to a lot of other peoples your fight is your own but the pain you feel is close to somebody elses that loneliness that separation everyone who has ever had something like this in their lives has gone through that feeling of an especially made pain for you dont hold on to it dont nurture it remember that many have beaten it so can you so can i so can everyone in this subreddit i am typing this message for you guys because you too deserve support i know for a fact youve saved lives but unfortunately people dont recognize you much for it and i know that is not the point nevertheless i admire your courage and perseverance you are amazing thank you for the ones in more precarious situations the ones that write or read for support of their own i have a bit of advice some days ago i was feeling especially down so i decided to walk alone i talk to myself a lot so i kept reciting these sad mumblings about my life to myself i just know that at some point i started to run with tears going down my face and with me just insulting life in general it helped there was a lot i had inside of me and fortunately it helped i have been worse than this bound to my bed empty and cold i can feel that coming back in those times i tried suicide never managed to go through but i ambeing completely honest what kept me going was a violent hatred for life fear and selfdoubt i dont have any selfconfidence so i just kept questioning my decisions strangely enough that helped me get through that rough patch the conclusioni am trying to reach is dont feel inadequate for your sadness dont feel like a coward for being afraid and dont feel like its your fault life is shit i know its easier said than done but truly remember you your body your mind whatever you want its fighting for you to stay alive your knowledge of your situation may help you help others your pain can one day become a strength unlike anybody elses if so many have battled through you can too youve taken a beating now use that blood to uh idk fucking skate over and punch life straight in the dick and if you need just come back herem and we will remind you why life is better than what it feels like much strength my dudes and wish me some too
1,just want to go awayi am17 years old male and i just want to go away again a few months ago i ran away from home because i was just done with life ive never had a reason to keep on living i just went through life without a goal i used to have a good amount of friends but they left me a year ago i made new friends and they left me too my life has only been downs and periods of time where its alright no positives i dont feel joy in livingi also feel likei am not allowed to make my own choices in life i have to follow all the rules that a couple of random people have decided on i dont really feel likei amliving my own life but while i was running away from home i did feel like i had the freedom to do whatever i want i liked that feeling but the police found me after i sent my location to one of my best friends who promised not to tell the police i felt betrayed and felt even shittier than before and since then december 2016 i havent had any positive moments in my lifei dont know what the fuck i want to do wheni amolder but i dont care anyway we all share the same ending to our life death so why not end it now or just make your own choices in what you want to do i really want to go away again either running away or just making an end to it altogether i know that some people will miss me but i dont want to stay just so i can make others feel better it sounds selfish but i wouldnt care anyway if i were deadgone and most of my friends already left me anywayi just want to go away
1,when you are the source of your problems most often people want to kill themselves because of problems coming to them like abuse bullying i willnesses etc but how do you cope when your problems are caused by you and only you i do cringeworthy shameful things and spill spaghetti out of my pocket way too often shame embarrassment regret and lowself worth run through my body everyday at a great intensity i dont feel any sort of direct sadness lonelines or grief so that probably makes my problems a little different from most others here i often invalidate myself because of this i feel like since every problem is caused by mei am not allowed to treat it like a problem but i am still allowed to validate my feelings this is a rational thought in my head so i guess thats a good start but i cant bring myself to feel it i still feel ashamed embarrassed regretful and of low selfworth all the timedoes anybody have any tips on how to overcome these feelings

1,lost everything becausei ama full blown narcissist the woman of my dreams a prospering career friends that people dream of having every moment is painful and it only gets worse and worse i want to end it but cant bring myself to do it that human will to survive is unbelievable why do you think youre a narcissist the way i understand things the vast majority of narcissists would never admit it which is why they cant ever get help and for donkeys ears it was believed that there is no cure for narcissism but apparently the underlying cause is recently assumed to be profound shame so heal the shame and cure the narcissism supposedlybut again most narcs never admit it which is why theres a high likelyhood that youre not so why do you think youre a narcissist

1,the past 6 months drained all of my energy i just wanna get this off my chest as i have nobodyi amwilling to talk to about thisi had to deal with health problems for a long time 8 years to be exact i wasnt able to go to school or work i sat at home all day and played games i lost a lot of friends was depressed and had my first suicide thoughts this is fairly irrelevant now but it may help to understand why i feel the way i do right nowin august 2016 i was finally able to start my apprenticeship as i was able to get my health problems under control i was able to work and go to school i gained new friends and good things happened in life by februarymarch i was happy with how things were going for the first time in 8 yearsbut then in april one of my best friends died in a motorcycle accident he lost control over his bike and hit an oncoming bus headon he died instantly this put me into a big hole my health problems started again i started missing at work sometimes i was in the office maybe 12 days a month i had to take medication to even make it to school i felt like complete shit during that time but did not have any suicide thoughts yet because everything else was going wellduring that time i lost contact to a girl i like a lot i dont have a crush on her or anything i just like her a lot as a person we talked and chatted a lot and everytime i was on the phone with her i was able to forget all my problems and it made me happy we talked about all kinds of stuff but i never told her this story but my constant asking to talk annoyed her a lot i could sometimes tell it did especially cause i knew she wasnt doing too well herself at that time but i still asked because i was depressed felt like shit and wanted to talk to someone to her she was the only person that could make me forget everything just before summer holidays we had a big falling out and we cut contact which made me feel even worse at firsti had 3 weeks of holidays in which i could relax and think a lot it helped me forget everything and feel a lot better but i couldnt forget her so before going back to school i texted her and we talked again i told her the whole story hoping shed understand why i acted like i did i told her thati amvery sorry i was a burden to her in a time she had to deal with her own problems i asked her if she could forgive me and give me a second chance she said shell think about it but 3 weeks later i know from a friend of her that she isnt really interested in keeping up contact with me anymorei am still in a big up and down rollercoaster from what happened in the past 6 months some days i feel great and the next day i think about how easy it would be to get rid of all my problems to forget everything i sometimes go days and weeks without being able to motivate myself for anything i just wanna lay in bed all day and cry but this with her this is really the last straw for me i have never met anyone who has such similar views about life and everything as i do i really miss talking to her on the phone or just chatting all day long i cant even put into words how much i regret everything i did i wish i could undo it but i canti could never do it myself i couldnt do it to my family my friends and everyone around me i know there will be better times eventually i have everything i could ask for in life but i amalmost hoping someone would run me over on my bike tomorrow and end my miserythank you for reading i already feel a lot better for now at least

1,amrunning out of energy ive been fighting this urge for so long i just dont know how much more i have in me i want so badly just to off myself but i dont want to abandon my family or put that burden on them so instead i wait here in this empty shell of a person hoping to simply fall over dead from some random wild disease but patience is not something ive really ever been good withi amat a fork in the road with the road ive already traveled crumbling behind and nothing but the choice of plummeting into an abyss or scaling an impossible cliff face in front of me i dont want to make the climb because i know for damn sure i will slip and fall but i cant go backwards because the road is crumbling and id just wind up back here in the future anyway i can make the leap into the abyss but i dont want my loved ones to follow me who gets to dictate this stuff who gets to decide what i do to myself certainly not anyone but myself yet somehow i feel obligated to stick around for the sake of my familys well being even though i dont contribute much at all 
1,help me take my mind off thisi amcurrently in the middle of a long journey by train after a distressing thing that happened earlier today i cant hold back the tears i want to cry and scream but i cant i feel helpless and the only thing i can think of is wanting to end the pain thats in my chest and stop the thoughts and thats the only thing that gives me comfort the thought that this can all end as soon as i get out of this miserable journey i dont really have the energy to type out the whole story here but suffice to say thati am tired of people i love treating me without any empathy at alli amon the way to having a good career and i amfairly talented but i feel that my life is a waste i smile at people at work all day and pretend thati amokay but i cry a lot i oftentimes take a walk alone and just cry my own family thinks that whatever distresses me isnt serious and sometimes say thati amjust messed up on the inside or if it were that serious id have tried to do something drastic already i see a therapist but i get no real help i almost want to end my life just to prove them wrongi want these episodes where i just cry cry and cry to just stop i feel horrible and helpless and it takes a lot for me to convince myself that tomorrow will be a better daythere are a few days wheni amhappy but every night before i go to sleep i always hope that tomorrow is not the day when it all ends again for me and then i go through days and days of just trying to survive because i have to the problem is i want to survive its just that people around me seem to try to do everything to prevent this whenever they figure out my vulnerabilitymy only hope in life is to be happy in the longterm but after many years of struggling i just want to know why shit always seems to happennow thati am trying not to cry in a public place where people are just trying to peacefully live their lives i think ive hit a new low that i didnt think was possible where i shed tears uncontrollably in a public place ive seen people laugh i hate myself and i hate that my life has taken this turnim expected at work tomorrow dressed up looking good and my suffering tonight will have been for nothing my life wont have changed and no one still understands my pain

1,suicide in every way except for actually killing myself yet hey guys this is just a vent type of post so sorry if i come across as annoyingas you may be able to tell from the title i am committing suicide in every way besides actually doing the deed i will not actually kill myself yet as i am still living with my parents i love them to death they are the sole reason i have not hungused an exit bag yet even though i have all of the materialsi am17 male and pathetic i would tell you guys why but its kind of complicated and i think i explained it pretty well in my other posts you could check them out on my profile if youd likebasicallyi ampurposely sabotaging everything i have its a form of self punishmentphysical sabotage i used to workout but ever since i had a mental breakdown about sports and weightlifting i have been eating just enough to survive i do this to lose almost all my muscle mass and athleticism for example used to have 34 standing vertical jump but now it is about 24 by an extreme caloric deficit i am working on becoming severely underweight malnourished and very weak to the point that walking is a chore basically imagine a skeleton with hair i have not been drinking much water either and am trying to stay in a steady state of dehydration again drinking just enough to stay alive i never exercise and force myself for example to take the elevator instead of stairs i know i am extremely lucky and fortunate to have a family that cares and access to all basic necessities but i reject them all i knowi amselfish and uncaring for doing these things but this is how much i hate myself ive even though about getting rid of an arm or leg by making a deep gash into my skin then exposing the gash to infectious diseases this would hopefully cause amputations i still take showers and brush my teeth because i hate being a nuisance to other people by smelling or something otherwise my body is a complete mess rightfully sofinancial sabotage i have a job in lawn care and make about 1250hr which is pretty good for now i am keeping my job for only 2 reasons reason 1 i am saving money to ease the financial troubles my family is going through divorce and both parents have low income reason 2 all the money left over i donate because i dont deserve any of it i feel better when i have no money in my wallet because i know thats what is right for meeducational sabotage i am a pretty good student 465 gpa and 32 act12 act writing thats great and all but this year senior year i am purposely trying to tank my grades i am trying to get all cs or ds so i can barely pass i like to see myself fail tests and assignments even if i know the answers i still choose the wrong ones my grades and act are from freshmanjunior year when i used to be ambitious and attempting to get into university of pennsylvania that dream is gone i do not want to be successful its not worth anything so since i have an all or nothing mindset i am choosing nothingrelationship sabotage this one is probably the least effective on me i dont have many friends but the ones that i do have i am breaking ties with i do things to make them think thati ama very mean and selfish person i sometimes talk back to my teachers to make them think lowly of me as well i still try to do the best for my parents by taking care of them and faking happiness so they can be happy i dont know if its working i dont care they have done so much for me i want to return the favor even if its not sincereso this is it guysi ammethodically ruining my life so suicide isnt that extreme when the time comes i will wait it out until i am as distant as ive ever been to my parents read halfway across the world with minimal contact in order to end it now is not the right time i just wanted to thank you guys so much for reading this far if you have it means a lot to me usually i write better but i have a time limit and i amtyping on the road at each stoplight so there are many breaks in my writing i will see you guys tomorrow no suicide here just eternal suffering 
1,whats the point ive hit that wall made some dumb drugdrink mistakes which led to bad choicesi amwithdrawing from alcohol and it feels awful i cant bring myself to tidy my room its disgusting i mean actually embarrassing not just messy ive let myself go these last few months have been awful i dont know where to start i need to lose weight i miss my anorexia it was like a friend my body hurts from constant laxative ods and right now i just need to ramble and writei am sorry its all about me i dont thinki ammeant to be alive if an animal was violent i will or just not functioning it would be humane to put it down so why not me 
1,ffff id fucking kill myself right now if i hade a private place to do it ohmygod i hate myself so much and i wanna die so bad
1,its not that big of a deali amconsidering suicide because i am an absolute failure at life failed academically failed socially failed everything theres nothing in my life worth salvaging i think about my family a lot what it would put them through and that blocks me from doing it committing to it but what harm is it to them really they will be depressed for a little while and then get over it my mother is the onei amworried about the most she is very weak mentally and wouldnt be able to get over it but at the same time she has religion and i think thatd give her strength i hope so at least ive considered writing in my suicide note that i asked for forgiveness for whati amabout to do and i am not a religious person but if asking for forgiveness helps my mother deal with it then id definitely do it my brother and sister would be depressed for a little while but i see them getting through it they are strong my dad would be angry at me and rightfully so but i dont think hed have a hard time getting over it ive thought a lot about losing out on happy experiences and all that but the way i see it its better that someone who is happy and fulfilled in life gets to experience those things instead and i know that those people are out there experiencing those things so its not so bad someone gets to do it it just wont be me i have a noose made and a place i want to go to do it but i dont think its long enough and i amafraid i will botch it theres also a shotgun in the house that i can use but itll be really hard to get access to it since my dad has hidden the key ever since my first attempti amterrified that my family will blame everything and anything and end up getting frustrated and angry at the whole thing but its entirely my own faulti amentirely to blame i want them to blame me but not hate me and i guess thats all i can do
1,diy how to survive i have wanted to kill myself for as long as i can remember since i was a kidi am26 now and dont know how to deal with it i have hurt myself in different ways many times over the years but havent made a full out serious attempt to kill myself because no matter how much i want to no matter how much i hate being myself i could not do that to my family i have an amazing family and i know that i am so privileged to say that they know that i have been depressed and support me when i told them thati amtaking antidepressants the treatment helps a lot but even after several months of increased medication i still think about how much i want to kill myself every day i dont know how to deal with it its a bizarre feeling because i know how i want myself to be and its really not hard its just beyond my grasp and i cant make myself be that person no matter how hard ive tried i dont want to try anymore i know i wont try to really kill myself because i truly do love my family that much but i am not sure how to handle these feelings i have already been seeing my doctor and shes a great doctor and knows everything i have told a few close friends about how bad it is and theyre very supportive of helping me get better but i dont know what to do next i just dont want to exist and i wish that there was a way that my loved ones would support it like when you have assisted suicide from a doctor and everyone is okay with it because they know how you are suffering and theres no chance of recovery i have been trying so hard to recover for so long i dont want to do it anymore 
1,there is no way i am surviving this school yeari am going to kill myself before june of 2018 i dont know when but i know it will be before then i cant take school its 7 hours 5 days a week plus hw i dont like most of my friends i will probably just end up with a shit 9 to 5 that i hate so i feel better off dead sooni amlosing a lot of my time to bullshit that i hate 
1,tell me suicide isnt the answer you cant plain and simple life is worthless we all die every single one of us whats the point of prolonging the inevitable what the hell does it matter if i die now or 50 years from now some of you might say what about how your loved ones would feel if you killed yourself well i will tell you this nobody really cares about anybody else but themselves this isnt coming from a place of angst but of truth human beings only understand the self its all we know as long as we arent 100 certain that the self is all that exists put simply my parents would only be upset because of how they would feel not because of any arbitrary love for me even more simply love is not real it is only a chemical reaction in our brains on top of this every single thing we do in life is just to get a rush of dopamine there is literally nothing else some of you will throw some feel good bullshit at me go ahead try and convince me life is worth living
1,at the end of my endurance i am a 24 yr old m i am severely depressedi cant get over how horrible this world is i hate it and most of the disgusting people in it i think people are awful and most of them are only out for themselves crushing everyone else in their wakei am offered nothing except for religious condolences from my parents who are the only ones i talk to any more it makes me fucking sick there is nothing more infuriating than being told everything will be alright by religious people fuck off i dont give a shit where people spend their eternity if it exists when people are cancerous to others around them they should be excised just like a tumor and the last thing i want to hear is that theyll get theirs that is such a cop out i cant even begini cant cope any more i dont have anything left i want to kill myself i dont think theres anything left on this speck of dust for me ive always been an outcast ive never been liked but i never hurt anybody i just keep to myself i dont know why everyone doesnt like me i just dont want to be in pain anymoredoes it get better or does it just keep getting worse i knowi am not old enough to know properly perhaps life hurts
1,hate myself ive had depression for 4 years ive tried almost everything i can to cure myself but everything in my life has gone wrong ive waited and waited and waited for some miracle or change of cicumstances to occur that will put an end to all the pain but ive finally accepted thati amdoomed to live a life of constant suffering and torment is that a life really worth living at this point i think the only winning move is not to play 
1,18m overdosed few days ago miraculously survived going to try again very soon i need help but it seems everyone who ive asked although empathetic has no idea of how i feel or why i want to die i suffer from these severe highs and lows with my mood fluctuating from extremely happyconfident and outgoing to 1 second later wanting to kill myslef i amjust done life isnt worth living if its like this and it seems no one understand whati am going through the next time i feel so lowi am going to do it and i will finally be set free 
1,to whoever this may concerni amending my life i wrote a detailed letter in here and then the battery on my phone died and now the entire long story is gonei will just make this short i stood by a woman who promised me loyalty and a better life and what i got is that she cheated and abandoned me wo car food or money and refused to take me to get pills i need and lied over over about taking me to the surgery i needed she cheated on me and tried everything to cause me to die getting in the way if medical needs and causing me to starve literally she refused to buy me food i was just abandoned while she is making over 7500 monthly income after taxes besides bonus she got a job as a director in a medical field she got that job because i lied for her by giving her a great review as a past employer i was never her employer she tried to kill me by stealing my cardiac pills she cheated on me started on thanksgiving with a subordinate asshole from that job she now has two incomes and two cars and i have nothing she preaches patient care to rge employees but literally caused situations over and over so i would die she actually tried to kill me in ways that would show as medical problemsi amnow in horrible living conditions toilet leaks snf rbe place smells like a sewer and i have no decision ability since i cant work she knew i cant work and told me after my open heart surgery that i will never work again abf that she will take care of everythingim miserable and tired of living i have no one to even write a goodbye letter toi amhomeless and hopeless i had a long detailed letter all typed out until the phone battery died and all the text was gonei want to die without anger i want to just cry but i cant even even do that i dont want to be in this world i dont belong here
1,self harm i don t do it often usually if i m drunk and feel alone and isolated but i don t consider myself suicidal at the moment i think i have seasonal depression and it s coming back but does anyone else self harm when they re drunk i can be hanging out with friends all night but the moment i m alone it happens i guess i m just looking for an excuse to do it i don t really know i kind of see the pain as a reality check if that makes sense it s a reminder to myself that no matter how happy i feel at the moment it s watching and waiting sorry for the weird post i just needed to say it 
1,what am i supposed to do wheni amliterally incapable of anything like seriously what is the point of living a shit youth suffering mental disorders physical defects massive failures just so that i can live a happy old life i dont see the point of all this the only reasoni amholding on rn is for the sake of my amazing parents they have done so much for me itd destroy them completely if i ended my pathetic existence this is so fucked up i cant live and i cant die too

1,i deserve it this past year has been rough i made a lot of friends and lost nearly all of them one after another for reasons ranging from disagreements about politics to someone legitimately trying to manipulate my friends into dumping me because they thought i was making everyone else depressed ever since then that person has been stalking me another person also started stalking me after they decided to end our friendship because i was being too nice to other people and he thought it was fake of me ive lost other friends countless friends throughout the years and these arent the ones that have hurt the most but theyre more in a string of bad endings to friendships that always seem to be my fault so ive been thinking i must deserve it i got up today thinking about ending my life and thats all ive been able to think about all day long my family would get over it my friends would find new friends if they havent already the people who live to torment me will probably be pleased as pie everyone can just go on without me and itll be fine the only thing stopping me right now is cowardice but i amseriously afraid that will eventually run out 
1,ama monster i dont deserve to live ive tried to put whati amfeeling into words but i cant accurately describe whati amfeeling its almost 4 am herei am not a native speaker and my mind is muddled by quetiapine but i need to get this ugly thing out of my chest basically ive been diagnosed with traits of bpdhpd not fully developed pds i display certain behaviours associated with those personality disorders and i feel likei ama bad person that deserves to die i want to gouge my eyes out tear my body apart and run away from myself ive been in therapy ever since i was 14 and ive still turned out fucked up there are tiny improvements but overall i feel i will never become a person that is worthy of having a happy life and being loved i mean all these years of therapy and no significant improvement i have a volatile relationship with my parents especially my motheri ama bad daughter and often i think itd be better for them if i died or killed myself i to kill myself if i cant be a good daughter a good person i dont even like a person i dont feel like a human being and i havent for a long time i feel like its not solid material things building my body but my selfhate and fear and anger and envyi am not even sure i can love maybe all i can feel when i love is an egocentric messed up childlike dependency maybe thats alli amcapable of if thats the case i absolutely do not deserve to have a family that loves me i dont deserve a life i genuinely dont want to die i dont want to notexist its a scary thought but i want to and deserve to kill myself i dont know how to help myself and transform my personality and maladaptive behaviours into something healthy and good and pure i honestly dont feel like theres an ounce of goodness in mei amjust a bad person trying but failing to be good theres not a single fucking redeeming quality about me except maybe the facti am trying to be better but i am not sure about that because i cant tell if its not just egodriven tbh i dont even feel i deserve to get better i promised myself i wouldnt be dramatic in this post but turns outi amstuck in my teenage emo phase also i knowi amhistrionic but i am not exaggerating for attention scouts honour i just needed to tell someone and i dont feel its okay to burden my friends with this and i amashamed of myself and i cant text my therapist at 4 amtldr i want to kill myself both as a punishment and because i cant live with myself please someone buy me tickets for a flight to destination not me tiai amexhausted i need a vacation
1,guys do you know some ways to get cancer this
1,i feel pathetic and lost hii amnew to reddit and sorry ifi am doing something wrong hereplease let me know my life is so pathetic and i honestly wish sometimes i dont know why i exist since grade school i was always the almost nonexistent friend that somehow gets bullied when i hit the spotlight for whatever reason ive left school twice to get home schooled and medical treatmenttherapy ever since ive always had a desire to be liked and known because of this whenever i see people i know having fun being surrounded by many people and exist in others lives i get extremely jealous i honestly feel pathetic that i even get jealous because i dont even deserve to be jealous prior to transferring to my current uni i was excited to start brand new and be part of the fun at such a prestigious university nowi ama senior and i am still alone with subpar gpa i regret everything ive done this past year because i havent done any impressive ecs low gpa and obviously no friends i feel so pathetic that i couldnt achieve a high gpa when i had no social life to begin withi amaiming for grad school phd but at this rate its probably impossible because of my below 35 gpa i constantly think about professors and grad students probably mocking me how i perform in classi amafraid of peers probably looking down on mei amconstantly overwhelmed with fear wheni amat school i was actually blessed to have a friend for a few months but one day i was shut down by the friend because i was pathetic weakwilled egocentric good for nothing this happened when i reached out to the friend when i was suffering with depression and anxiety after that it has scarred me tremendously and ive became afraid to be friends or open up to anyone now i spend everyday alone ive lost touch with all my friends from back home after moving i cant stop thinking about how my grades are poor the loneliness and my selfworth i honestly feel like i have no talent in anything and it makes me wonder what purpose i serve in this world i really feel like a good for nothing just like the friend said i dont have or ever had anyone who would even care about me i cant stop thinking about ending everything probably the only thing i would miss holding me back is my parents and boyfriend that i semitrust but i cant seem to have enough energy to continue and care about them i probably am egocentric because i pretty much can only care about how i feel and what i want i can only seem to care about the happiness that will come out of suicide i just really want to disappear
1,i dont know whyi ammaking this i guess its a last ditchi amvery near killing my self ive struggled with a gun to my head countless times never having pulled the trigger my fianc aborted our boy without telling me and then left mei amabsolutely dead inside the only thing i feel at all is morbid depression she was my life we were starting a family i loved her more than life in every sense of the term i miss her a disgustingly my world the other morning i woke up in the hospital with no one around confused as to where i was and how i got there until i looked on a tray besides me and saw my empty bottle of adavan and pain killers looked in my phone and saw some pretty cold texts between the two of us pieced it tougher i went on suicide autopilot and swallowed enough prescription drugs to kill a horse i dont know how it didnt work it made me sick i gathered my shit from the room and left without saying anything to anyone these last few days have been getting worse and i dont think theres anything left for me i love her so damn much and she killed our baby without even telling me i want to die i dont see any way around it i know people have been through worse than this but i amjust not strong enough i know i will hurt people but i want this disgusting pain to be over

1,developing schizophrenia i am losing reality every day that goes by i hear voices daily theyre not next to me theyre not whispering in my ear they are always outside of my room door in the kitchen in the vents ive seen a screaming face come out of my poster in my room i have seen an arm reach toward me coming from out of my curtain i have extreme paranoia i can not trust anymore i do not trust my girlfriend even though she says she promises to not do things that will hurt me all of her friends hate me apparently my paranoia makes me a horrible person my paranoia is completely justified to me i am absolutely right the entire world saysi amwrongthe only thing i am able to do that makes me feel better is remembering the thought of judgment day coming anyone who has hurt me and brought evil to the world without an inquiry of forgiveness or guilt will be dealt with and all of the pain and suffering will be brought to an equilibrium by justice may god accept my never ending plea for forgiveness and may he protect me from all evil including whatever my never stopping thoughts arei will not suicide its a sin but wow how beautiful the thought is to leave this worldly life theres too much suffering for me to handle
1,my parents dont seem to understand they dont seem to understand that if you yell at your child for using depression as an excuse for everything call them a lazy piece of shit or say she says she has depression but wont say why shes depressed its disgusting that just makes me not want to tell them i want to kill myself as well so much for having loving and supporting parents
1,amclose and it scares me i recently started college and quickly made some friends they were nice but when feelings of depressionsuicide returned i pushed them away so nobody at my school would care when i die i will just b that kid that not many people knew that killed him self during 1st semester without friends all i think about is suicide i took a run through the woods today to scout out trees that could handle my weight when i hang myself i hate myselfi ama burden on other people and theyre better off without mei amjust a pussy that needs to go die
1,am not good i dont really have problems with confidence in myself or with talking to people i just often decide what i have to say isnt worth wasting peoples time with though i guess maybe that is a problem with confidence i dunno i feel confident i just feel likei ama waste of chemicals and i want to die

1,first suicidal thought in seven months hello last year i suffered a concussion that gave me some awful symptoms including brain fog memory loss decline in social skills extremely uncomfortable feelings in the back of my head and more it was too much to cope with especially after 4 months of going to doctors and not getting any diagnosis i decided killing myself was the only way to escape my seemingly eternal condition i set a date in may and started planning around february i started feeling a little less bad and the doctors also prescribed me some medicine and exercises to get me on the right track so i stopped feeling suicidalat some point during the first four months when i was still trying to figure out what exactly was wrong with me i visited an ent and he prescribed me nose spray which ended up having nothing to do with the problem i started noticing some weird feelings in my nose and ear after taking it for a couple weeks so i stopped the nose feeling never really went away though fast forward about 6 months and i was almost fully healed from the concussion symptoms all of the sudden the nose symptom got a lot worse my entire left nostril felt like the contents had been sucked out of it with a vacuum and now the flow of air is way too strong all of the air flowing in makes both my throat dry and soar all the time and creates this irritating scrapey feeling above my left ear on top of that it seems like some of the brain fog symptoms i was describing earlier have returned along with this thing and i feel like my entire head is a mess againim currently visiting some doctors to see if they can provide any insight but dealing with it for a month and only seeing it get worse is really demoralizing i feel depressed and anxious constantly and kinda feel like i wanna die again idk how longi amgonna be able to hold on this time if my body keeps bombarding me with all of these symptomsjust really needed to vent somewhere thanks for reading
1,nothing is getting better everything i try and do just blows up in my face my friends are leaving me life is pathetic and pointless all i ever wanna do now is smoke weed constantly to get through and half enjoy the day my life is going nowhere man god i hate it here 
1,trying to take the emotion out of it i gave been miserable for awhile now i dont know why but i cant remember the last time i was actually happy despite this i am trying to look at my life logically while removing the emotions from the equation i dont see a path to me being happy i am not that interested in my job it pays well but i dont really enjoy it to be honest i have never had an answer to the question what do you want to do when you grow upi am33 now and i still dont have an answer i dont hate my job but it is just something i do to pay bills the only good thing about my job was this one person i work with long story short i caught feelings for her but she had a boyfriend we became really good friends and she is single now but i am too much of a coward to make a move plus i want her to be happy and i dont think i could make her or anyone happy the hobbies i used to have dont interest me anymore either i used to spend hours and hours playing video games with my brother and friends but about a year ago i completely lost interest in them i try to play them now and i just get bored i also used to be a huge sports fan i would watch football and basketball and pay attention to all the news in the offseason now i could care less i am in a fantasy football league and dont even know what players are on which team anymore i have lost interest in life and am just miserable on most days i recently moved away from my friends and family to try to put some distance between us i want them to get used to the idea of not having me around i would like to be around to see my nephews and niece grow up but when i really think about it they will be better off without me i dont want them looking up to me in anyway and wanting to be like memy plan is to get through this holiday season and then i will probably end i all sometime early next year there are some people at work i want to set up to get promoted that really deserve it in the next couple of months i am also going to be really stingy with my money so i can leave some for my family i plan on buying a one way ticket to a country in europe and ending my life over there i will ditch all my ids and then kill myself my hope is that my body wont be identified and my family can always have hope thati am still alive i dont even really know why i am writing this i guess i am just venting i dont see my life getting any better and i dont have any motivation to go on the way things are i am trying to be logical about this please let me know if there is any fault in my thing
1,want to die life isnt worth living dropped out of college due to anxiety stuck at the same job for years nothing is getting better just someone convince me to just fucking end this becausei am too much of a bitch to just do it myself
1,just tried killing myself feeling even worse first off i have social anxiety and depression ive never really been very confident around people or by myself for that matter so doing things that seem basic and trivial to most people is always very challenging ive had depression for just over a decade seen several therapists and even tried helping myself by trying to be more active and outgoing but ultimately i will just end up repeating a cycle of being happy for a while and then horribly sad as i start to doubt whether i can truly stay happy that these people around me dont really care about what happens to me that theyre not really hanging out with me because they want to but out of pity that my moods are ruining everyone elses vibe that whether a small mistake i made still gets talked about behind my back that i have no value as a friend or lover or person that when i try to commit suicide i cant even do that becausei am too much of a coward and just feel like dead weighti am so lonely and scared i cant trust people because of a rough childhood growing up in a bad neighbourhood and mostly experiencing betrayal and verbal abuse and its killing me inside i made this throwaway so that maybe at least someone could see this i really dont know what to do anymore
1,titanic so e has been doing a marathon of movies lately and one of them is titanic does anyone else find roses suicidal tendencies incredibly romantic and enticing her life is perfect but she cant keep herself off the edge i found it highly relatable
1,anybody else feel this way my thoughts have been possessed by suicide ideation whenever i mention this people say i have so much to experience i am only 14 but i dont want to not be suicidal until i ultimately find get a gun and kill myself impulsively for i believe that happy people are delusional filth suicidal thoughts are enlightenment and it is ignorant to try and get rid of them only reason i havent killed myself through a nonimpulsive way is because iwant to read on suicidea discourse on voluntary death to improve my note quality sadly my parents refuse to let me buy it does anyone agree with my sentiments or am i just crazy
1,honestly dont know how to cope with life anymore i honestly never thought id be typing on this subreddit the fact that i am makes me feel even worse i feel guilty because part of me loathes selfpity but i am scared that one of these days i might actually do something really dumb thats whyi amhere this is my first post on this site i literally made an account so i could talk to someone to give a little bit of a backstory because i didnt just wake up like this will probably be helpful i have a history with depression and anxiety i have a history with abuse selfabuse self harm abuse from others ive been romantically involved with and sexual abuse from my childhood now on paper or online that all seems really dark and it is but it doesnt encompass who i am and looking at me youd never be able to telli am an above average attractive 24 year old woman i have very strong metaphysical beliefs and i honestly believe in the good of mankindi amintelligent ive had to fight to get where i am mentally and emotionally to come off as really stable i moved states a year ago to start over and moved to an amazing major city with 400 in my pocket and i made a life for myself here i finally started living a life that i thought i deserved a month ago a girl ive been friends with said to me i honestly dont how youre so stable and inside i chuckled to myself because she like everyone else only sees the surfacei amwhat youd call a functioning depressive to put things in perspective if any of you have ever taken a meyersbriggs personality testi am an enfp robin williams was an enfp my number one goal is for people to not see me suffer because i never want to make anyone sad i hate asking for help i hate telling peoplei amsad to guilt them into wanting to be around me i know its very selfdestructivei ama very selfaware person i was in counseling and also saw a psychiatrist about a year ago because i barely felt like i could keep my head above water i was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder with depression an a general anxiety disorder i scored very high on a dissociation test i would be in the middle of work and kind of black out and forget what i was doing two minutes later ive almost gotten in car accidents because of that as well it makes me seem very spacey and ditzy at times when really i just go somewhere in my head without my permission because its how i learned to cope with trauma as a child my best friend tried to kill herself last december as well shes my roommate and i found her in the bathtub full of blood and had to drive her to the hospital after it had snowed 6 inches the night before december of 16 was my bottom so i started medication to be honest it really fucking helped it got me out of my head enough to focus on my job i got back together with someone who i was very fond of that initially ended because of my instability and things were going great i felt like november december 2016 was my bottom and i fought my way out and got to a stable place then may 17 happened i started to wean back on my medication because i didnt feel like myself anymore i was still in counseling trying to cope with what happened to me in my childhood and deal with that but i didnt feel any emotions i couldnt cry anymore i would be in a room full of people having an amazing time and pretending i felt something so i started to correctly wean off of my meds i had been on them for less than a year and i read how to properly decrease my dose to avoid harsh sideeffects about a month after i completely quit i felt back to me without the ups and downs i could paint again i paint quite frequently and the medication made me not want to do that anymore i could cry and most importantly i could feel things but it got worse i couldnt control my emotions anymore in a responsible way i would lash out at the people i cared about about what i mean 50 of it may have been legitimate things part of subconsiously hating yourself is attracting not so loving people into your life or people who are just as good at suppressing emotions as you are 50 of it was also me lashing out because everything the medication suppressed was and is now at the surface so i ruined a relationship with that guy he wont speak to me anymore which is fine i dont think we were meant to be romantically anyways but i apologized to him a month and a half later for the bad fall out we had and he never said anything i felt really stupid for that and internalized it as something very idiotic that i did i have always tried to escape these issues through relationships i have attachment issues my love language is quality time so i tend to kind of monopolize a new person or a personi amromantically involved with with wanting to spend time with them like all the time part of this is just how i bond part of this is also escaping myself i have recently been involved with a person now for a couple months i dont know if he emphathetically understands these issues not that its his responsibility to fully grasp them but in this situation ive tried to be very selfaware so i dont do those things like lash out etc this person has been of great support to me he has helped pull me out of neutral i have started to find purpose in myself again and a reason for being here today i lashed out at him for something very trivial we are not officially dating because were millenials and its only been a couple months but i love his family they love me i love his dog we spend a majority of our free time together and i find that we really compliment each other in so many ways i truly adore him of course there is a catch when i met this person he told me that he might be going to europe for an extended period of time in the fall so thats part of the reason we to keep it casual but it just ended up getting more serious and eventually his me statements became we statements i sometimes feel with this person i am on a rollercoaster once we started to get more serious he kind of pulled back to make sure he was making all the right decisions regarding his emotions and my emotions i respected that but with all of my relationship insecurities i saw it as a big red flag that hes just going to dip out come time hes reassured me that he could never rid me of his life but maybe that isnt good enoughi am looking for something to give me purpose so i dont kill myself one dayi am looking for it in the wrong places and the wrong people and i amaware of that but old habits die really hard its like watching a character on a movie screen make all of these mistakes and from the theater youre yelling stop doing that but they just keep doing it over and over again part of me thinks i should cut things off to save him from me to save myself the inevitable heart break i will no doubt feel when he decides to leave for europe without me part of me knows i lash out because yeah i am insecure as f about where the relationship is going but also because i have deep seated emotional fears i fear that i will be forgotten i fear that i will drive everyone away from me i fear that even when there is a light at the end of the tunnel my destructive patterns will not let me see it because the dark and malicious part of my personality wants me to feel absolute misery it has convinced me that is a safe and inevitable state of mind believe me when i say if you met me youd think i was the queen of positivity i want everyone to experience love and to feel loved for some reason i wont allow that for myself and it kills me suicide at this point albeit fucking terrifying for so many reasons seems less and less terrifying each and every day the first time the thought crossed my mind i was freaked out now its where my mind jumps to the peace that i would feel even for a millisecond of not having to upset anyone anymore i have a very loving and supportive family but they dont know any of this my best friend is doing great now from her dark time back in december and i feel like if i bring anything up its going to remind her of that and send her into a relapse i bottle all of this up i even asked the guy thati amseeing to see him because i felt scared to be alone because of my thoughts but he said that he thinks its best if we both have space tonight because of how i lashed out at him earlier so nowi amembarrassed i feel guilty for even bringing that up to him i feel like he doesnt care does anyone i guess whati am looking for is for a reason not to do it eventuallyi amopen to anything really i wouldnt be here posting this if i didnt feel so low maybe someone can also direct me to a subreddit with supportive females or supportive people with experience with childhood sexual abuse trauma i internalize everything everything ends up being my fault even when it isnt and its a vicious cyclei amjust hoping that before i choose to like literally end my life i keep going on the off chance that something good will happen howi am not seeing that i dont get it but i just dont at the moment 
1,its just been so longi am so tired of dealing with this with mental i willness and insecurities and anxiety attacks i just want to make it stop already
1,ive wanted to kill myself every day for 7 years every single day but i ama coward this is my balance youre not a coward for wanting to live use that inner strength to better yourself as a person
1,told everyone i want to die still want to die it just came spilling out of me one night when talking to my mom then i stumbled into telling an empathetic acquaintance when i asked her for advice on something over drinks a few days later during an anxiety attack a friend messaged me and i impulsively told her that ive been suicidal for the past year and that i was having a mental breakdown and nowi amtelling you internet strangerim not sure what i expected to get out of telling people i guess i was looking for some reason to live to just hit me but it hasnt now i just feel more trapped than ever if i kill myself nowi am going to cause any immense amount of pain and guilt my death wouldnt have been painless for my parents anyway which is why ive forced myself to live for so long but now i would be a complete fucking asshole for killing myself after i told them i think the problem is that i now feel obligated to improve and i dont know how to do that ive been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for a year now changed therapists 3 times now insurance issues long story the drugs dont work though and as for the therapy the simple fact is that you cant decide for someone that their life is worth living i have been suicidal many times over my life but they were at emotional crisis points when i hated myself i dont necessarily hate myself now i just havent thought life was worth living for a year now and i still dont food is unappetizing nothing is funny anymore i dont get joy from anything all that remains is an obligation to others thats all i have left 
1,i wanna kill myself so desperately i am absolutely tired of this loneliness this lack of human connection and compassion the fact that i am unlikable and cant talk to people i dont see any future for me i dont see how i can survive the adult world as i am not a competitive person and my social skills are down the drain i cant do anything right success and love of any type just seem like they werent meant for me i wanna die sooo bad but i dont wanna hurt my family i am waiting till the latter half of my 20s to commit suicide i am 20 so maybe i can give life a chance but i cant wait till then for now i will just hope something kills me i dont know how much longer i can take this i am sooo 110 fucking done

1,i dont know how to open upi ama 19 year old college student and ive had this problem for my entire life i dont know how to be open about how i feel i was bullied and neglected by my friends throughout high school and middle school and i feel like this and past painful experiences have made me too afraid to tell people wheni amupset or how i feel about things in general my college friends have been nice to me but i feel likei amstarting to be neglected by them too because i constantly feel likei ambeing left out of their conversations and when we hang out they hardly talk to me i always come up with witty jokes to make them laugh and they often tell me how talented i am but i feel likei amjust an entertainer to them rather than a friend i want to be able to have real conversations with them and tell them how i feel but they always ignore me and drown me out i have aspergers which makes this especially difficult because sometimes they get impatient with how slow i am to say things and also it sometimes doesnt come out quite right and they dont fully understand whati am trying to say when i do manage to get something out just being around them feels so degrading if i talk about wanting to kill myself or being depressed they thinki amjust joking so they think nothing of it and carry on talking to each other when we get drunk together is the only time i have enough courage to say how i feel but i am still drowned out if i had access to more alcohol id probably have a serious drinking problem because the only time i feel released from the pressure of social anxiety stress and negative thoughts is wheni amdrunki amunable to ease my depression from crying because i feel likei amno longer physically able to its the worst feeling being trapped inside your own mindmaybe i dont give them enough to work with to deserve their care or respect i sometimes feel like i dont give them enough of my attention to deserve theirs i think of committing suicide all the time but ive never gotten enough courage to try it but i feel like i wont be able to live like this for much longer because i will soon have to face this while dealing with trying to find a decent job and facing the world
1,this could be my last night i don t think i can control myself anymore i don t trust myself to not do it i ve been depressed for a few years now not diagnosed because i don t dare to talk to anybody about it i try to keep up a facade about being happy i want people to like me i don t think many people know how i feel a few close friends might have figured it out i m not sure i m not sure why i m depressed i don t have any good reasons i ve never had any problems getting friends or girls even though i ve never had a relationship so i don t understand why i fell this wayone year ago i moved away to college and it s not going well i m failing classes and most days i don t even leave my bed some friends in class have asked why i m not going to the lectures but i make up excuses to seem cool some days i put a knife to my throat just because i like the feeling of being in control of my own lifethis story is probably incoherent and missing a lot of details but i just wanted to express how i feel my first language is not english and i m drunk at this moment sometimes when i drink alcohol i forget how i feel but most times it just makes it worst i think it s part of the problemanyways thanks for reading this might have been the last thing i m ever going to write i m not sure yet

1,i think i m already dead and i must have done something really awful stuff to be sent to hell this constant and never ending circle of hopelessness loneliness false promises making me believe even just for a fraction of a second that there is a way out when there isn t teasing me and then laughing in my face when i realise it s all lies i have done something horrible and i m already dead and hell is nothing like i imagined there are no fires and burning for all eternity just a repeating simulation of life and then ripping the dreams and hopes out of my heart to punish me for my existencethinking back all the way to my childhood i had dozens of surgeries even before i was 6 promising me to fix me but then another surgery and another promise i started school and started it again at another school going to high school and finishing it at a second one then more surgeries more promises to be normal more false hopes to ever being a father only to be laughed at when people realise what i was born with or without going to uni and taking that away from me then a second uni and taking that away from me too working my ass off to build up a career and either let me screw up or snatch it out of my hand so everything i ve built and worked hard for comes crushing down on me over and over and over and over againwait until i just about to have enough give me something to hold onto watch me build something again and then just when i start to feel it s worth living take it away and throw me back into the pitschools jobs relationships hobbies friends crushes love none of that is real just tools of torture that is out of my controland the only way to break that cycle is to kill myself again then erase my memory grown up again torture me again then kills myself again and the circle never endswhat other explanation is there i know it s my fault it has to bei get the message whoever sent it to me i must do a reset soon die again by my own hands get sent deeper into the bowls of hell and see how long it takes until i realise again i need to die once more and again and again and againi have a countdown a deadline i set years ago i need to bring it forward and stop waiting stop trying stop living just stop

1,i almost killed myself last night i had the razor ready to slice down my wrists but i couldnt do iti am too much of a fucking failure to even follow through with it i hate myself
1,no safety thank you for reading i feel like i have no one that understands or gets it ive always been extremely anxious ever since i was around 5 years old and i have been depressed since about 11 years old ive had recurring suicidal thoughts since about 13 i am now 24 and i wasnt diagnosed with chronic major depression until a couple of years ago ive had my first attempt last year i had a very intense fight with my mom she was listening in on me telling my boss that i need a break from work because of my mental health problems my goal was to end my life after that fight but i still dont believe it was an attempt i cant wrap my head around the fact i did attempt suicide because nothing happened i didnt end up unconscious or anything from the half of bottle of pills that i took i could hear my mom saying she wanted to kill herself and my dad telling her to put down the knife i snapped out of whatever mental break i had when i took the pills and i told my dad what i did he drove me to the hospital afterward i was treated evaluated and was voluntarily committed to another mental hospital for 2 weeks the treatment i received worked for some time but my depression came back around june my suicidal thoughts started in july and i have been cutting again to cope my family isnt exactly supportive i have an older brother who has problems too but he is basically verbally abusive towards my mom and i he will call me anal whore slut and use christianity to put me down hes not even a christian i am not comfortable dating or having relationships so i dont at all he constantly brings up the one and only guy i went out with a few years ago to tell mei amforever his bitch he would text me offensive and creepy things before i started forwarding his texts to the rest of my family they wont do anything he is literally a troll he will constantly say the exboyfriends name or call me a bitch if my parents arent around he would make kissing noises and faces at me if i was around or drive by him he has said unprovoked that i should kill myself after i was out of the hospital he cant keep any job and lacks any kind of common sense or respect he will act like a crazy jerk in our house but he will quickly act normal if he is outside of our neighborhood my dad tells me to ignore him but how do you ignore something like that he wont bother or threaten my father or other brothers he is about 6 and my mom and i are under 52 he has smacked my mom in the face before and i have gotten into physical altercations with him as well my dad is usually there to stop them but he doesnt have much authority ever since the police told my father the owner of the house can kick my brother out hes stopped caring because its my mothers responsibility they keep allowing him to come back i dont feel safe in my house or in my neighborhood anymore the boy and i use to ignore each other if we ever cross paths but he now makes it a point to harass me even outside i am constantly looking over my shoulder he has even attempted to walk in the middle of the road if he sees me driving down the street and he will do something obnoxious when i drive by him anyway my mom will constantly say hes not normal but she allows him to continue living here she owns the house and i cant stand her enabling him my brother is aware of this and he has recently started shouting at my mom no power i literally have nowhere else to go and i dont have a car i feel trapped i have a moderate to severe autoimmune disease and it can prevent me from going to work or school i feel like between my depression disease shame and crappy family that i would be better off dead if he went away life wont be as depressing and i can effectively deal with my other personal issues more often i was already depressed before he started becoming a monster but it feels like there is no safe place to recover with him lurking in the house sorry for the long post thank you again for reading

1,realisation time to vanish were to startive got bipolar and whilst writing thisi amon a serious down so its a struggle to even attempt to express my feelings but i feel kinds hopeless i believei amonly truly happy when ive got something to look forward too that thing was university this has suddenly been snatched from me as i was not invited to join back the second year of my college course reasoning behind this is because i work 50 odd miles away from the college and unlike students therei amolder 21 so have responsibilities and such luckily ive been offered a position at another college to do their send year this means though my job i currently have wouldnt be possible to do anymore as its too much of a journey so that part is really getting me down and also ive had a really rough time whilst being at my parents house my mother despises me and my farther left before i was born and refuses to acknowledge my existence meaning the 2 people who are meant to be there for me dont give a shit it sucks because me and my mum used to be inseparable and she was like my best friend now she wont even answer me when i talk to her just ignores me so leaves me feeling alone i also have a girl ive been seeing but because of my bipolar it makes not so hard to even show emotion towards her i dont miss her and that worries me but i just dont feel it i wouldnt be upset if she left me but i dont want her too i just want to feel normal and not a emotionless twatfeel like theres nothing left we live we die whats the point of waking up unhappy 
1,sucidal thoughts i m 20 i currently work in retail after leaving a web development job which i didn t enjoy so i left after a week it gave me depression feeling like a guinea pig i ve been dating my girlfriend for 8 months now she s 18 and i ve been living at her parents house since we dated my mum has a two bedroom flat but she keeps meeting random guys and sometimes i hear them having sex and it gets to me she s a single mum as my dad left me at child birth we don t really get on and talk rarely my girlfriend is now going to university left today and i ve depended on her so much for happiness that i don t know how to be happy without her we ve talked about the future to the point of me engaging her in a few years time i m moving by chance to a new job opportunity 20 minutes away from her but will only be on the odd occasion be able to see her on the weekends and i can t cope with the idea of that i trust her but i depend on her and i fall down the ditch of suicidal tendencies when i m alone i ve researched what i can do and where i can get the equipment i ve not discussed this with her because i m not here to blackmail someone into submission that s both selfish and weak on my behalf i worry that no job will satisfy me and i m in an endless loop that ll make me unhappy i m not happy with that amount of time i ll be able to see her compared to other people and i just can t live happily with myself as i feel like i ve been born to die i never seem content with what i have and i can t cope alone and alone is exactly what i m going to be is it really so bad just for me to call it quits i ll break her heart but i feel like there s no other way and that this is the end i can hand on heart tell you now that if she broke up with me that i would 100 end it i m not waiting for that eventuallity because i know she isn t the type but i feel like i need to do this for me people are born for every statistic to be killers and everything else and i feel that because of how my life has affected me that only death can set me free but i always think this way when i m down but maybe this is the bullet that ll get me out i m just not sure what to do and everything seems to lead to my unhappiness and abandonment issues to get the end of me edit we have spoken about how i am as i lost the will to live when she went away on a holiday it s not jealousy it s just me not being ok with myself i tell her i don t want to talk to her about my problems all the time because that pushes people away even if they say it doesn t
1,i just want someone to talk to i dont want to do this alone i finally built the courage to tell the one person that i can go to that i was going to kill myself he blew me off now i have nobody i know its pathetic but i just need someone to talk to i just dont want to be completely alone when it happens
1,nothing changes i used to be a drug addict and dealer i hated my life and everyday i hope i would find the drive to kill myself or overdose one day i thought it was my rock bottom nowi am sober and somehow managed to get to a job the pays extremely well but i still want to die more now than back then every single day for most of the day i think about it i look at myself in the mirror and i want to put a bullet through that persons headi amscum and i dont deserve life love happiness friends and family i cant keep on like this for much longer i already have for far too long
1,how to stay happy i have posted on here several times before each time i have been talked out of killing myself however i am tired of being talked out of it i want to either stop being miserable or just die i recently quit my job at mcdonalds because it was making me more suicidal than ever and have been going to college i am scared of my horrible grades as i think i may go on academic probation after that i will have large student loans pilled up on my head no job and no way to ever get a job that isnt a dead end job that makes me want to kill myself therefore i have decided if i go on probation i will kill myself i have gotten obsessed with the idea of death lately i think about what death would be like and ways i could quickly die about 70 of the day what is bothersome to me is that other people who have the same situation or even worse situations are able to stay happy this is frustrating to me not because these people are happy but because i feel like i am completely missing something that these people are is it genetic is it a mindset if it is either how could we ever change our mindsets or genetics after all we are who we aretldr i am extraordinarily unhappy because of many situations and am likely going to kill myself at the end of the semester unless i can find a way to stay happy i am tired of being talked out of it this is a final decision instead i want advice to be happy
1,i think ive realized what hurts the most about all of this and thats that i didnt even get a choice i was born with this difference disorder i willness whatever you want to call it i didnt get to choose to be normal and even if i had started the treatment options earlier my body and mental health would have always been fucked i cant stand being trans if i wake up tommorow still feeling dysphoria i might really end it 
1,i think my mom is going to kill me i dont want to die right now i love my friends too muchbut i might have to my sisters boyfriends mom wants to talk to me i am in a mental health awareness club that my mom doesnt know about and so is my sisters boyfriend my mom is deep in denial that i have any kind of mental i willness and has invalidated me mocked me screamed at me and threatened to hurt me for showing signs i wasnt supposed to let anyone at school know i have to find places to hide ifi am going to break down at school because if the counselor knows my mom will somehow find outmy moms on the phone with his mom right now the club is the only thing my sisters boyfriend and i have in common if my mom finds outi am not sure what shell doi am going to try to tell her its just for leadershipto help friends but i am really scared my mom screamed at me and called me a lazy ass because i told her i was slightly anxious about school i dont know whats going to happen and i dont want to live in an environment where its not safe for me in any way i dont want to live thinkingi amalone in this if my mom finds out i think i will have to or i could just not live at allto whoever is reading this i love youi am sorry you were brought to this sub and i hope with all my heart things get better for you i am going to do my best to stay alive for my friends and i hope youll find a reason as wellill try to update thisthank you for listeningedit it was a false alarm she wanted to talk about something elsei am so relieved but my heart is still racing it sucks to be living in an environment that scares me as much as it does but thank you for caring you guys were there even when i thought i was going to die that means a lot to me thank you i love you guys
1,i am tired of being transgender my biggest problem with being trans is that i feel no one believes me even cis people that understand or say theyre an ally it feels like everyone around me thinksi amcrazyi am not really a woman trapped in a male body i just think i am and you know what maybe its truebut that doesnt make it hurt any less every time i see a group of girls talking about nothing knowing that i will never join them never be one of them it feels like being punched in the gut and it doesnt go away everyday again and again ifi amjust crazy its damned persistenteverything i see online and at work tells me that the trans community will never be accepted feminists see us as men and dont want us anywhere near them lesbians see us as men and i amattracted to girls lucky me s men just see us as gay gay guys want to drop the t from lgbt altogetherthe only treatment for being transgender is to transition but asi amconstantly reminded that wont make me a real woman so whats the pointand so this is why i want to kill myself its become increasingly obvious to me that trannies have no place in this world i have no place in this world and i amdone fighting my dysphoria everyday only to be mocked and told thats its not realits just not worth it anymore
1,i hope i get killed before i kill myself someone pm me please i dont want to do iti dont want to die at all i just want the pain to end if i die i want it to be quick like a car crash i could handle that because at the end of the day my mom wouldnt be the mom with the depressed kid shed be the unlucky mom there wouldnt be anything she couldve done to prevent it i dont want my friends beating themselves up over a problem they couldnt fix theyd remember the good qualities i had the school wouldnt have any class about depression and how to tell the signs theyd just hold a small vigil no one would go to and id be forgotten as quick as the crash was 
1,amstarting to have suicidal thoughts ive always told myself that i wouldnt succumb to my emotions especially after my brother took his own life a couple of years back my thoughts on the topic of suicide have gradually grown over timeim sustaining myself with a job ive worked for 3 years now and i amcurrently enrolled in college ive had to see every single one of my friends go on to do better things while i sit here doing the same old shit and have the feeling thati am not making progress i lost the best girl i ever had in my life because i let my anxiety get the best of me and ruin the relationshipi tend to talk to myself and sort issues out and i try to tell myself that its all temporary but i amstarting to lose faith i found myself today planning it all out in my head while i was at work i dont know if id actually go through with it but i actually thought of how and when and should i write a notei dont know whats wrong with me and it might just be a phase but its getting worse
1,i want to die but i ama coward i have been suicidal since the age of 6 but never went through with it why because i am a fucking coward i dont have the balls to do anything including killing myself the only reason that i have lived this long is becausei ama fucking pussy well ive found a way to get past all that when i get extraordinarily high in combining whatever the fuck i have on me that fear disappears all i want to do is die and i amready to do it all i have to do is pop those pills drink a ton while tripping and i amgood to pull the fucking trigger itll be quick i wont feel a damn thingi ama failure as a human being and i dont belong in the gene pool the sooner i kill myself the sooner itll all be over and nothing will matter at all by thenwhat is the fucking point of living like this
1,i feel likei amlosing my friend and idk what to do so my friend has recently lost friendship with his best friend it looked complicated and she was very in love with him they stopped being friends for unrelated reasons he is very depressed and doesnt take his depression seriously or believes he is i feel like hes pushing everything back and acting tough so he does not get help for him self and hes had a suicidal history ever since losing his friend his personality is nonexistent now he was down and depressed looking before they met but i thought it was his regular personality after he met her he would actually smile occasionally and be in a completely different mood so it finally clicked and i realized he shouldnt be that way now hes way worse than beforei amafraid hes not taking care of himself hes closed off so idk how to go about asking him without making things worse idk any close friends of his who i can tell idk what to do and i amafraid time is ticking any suggestions
1,november maybe two days ago i decided that if the upcoming month really went as horrible as i feel it will id be gone by november its the sweetspot between various deadlines i have no control over and more specifically the monthi amliable to be homeless homeless or shoved back in with my stepfathers horrible parents and i choose the former in place of returning at the heels of hags that threw us away like they did all their sons said i was on track to becoming a whore called my brother and mother both wastes of space i will be positively if i go back to that fear of just walking to the bathroom of literally living in the attic and being sideeyed for breathing ive only told three people what they did to us so if anything getting it out is cathartic catharsis however does nothing to help what extends past emotion though i wish someone would hold me for just a moment i literally cannot exist dont have the papers dont have the papers to get the papers things wouldnt improve if i just packed myself across the country and stayed with friends that only half know me nor would they really improve if i had the money to fill my college seat fee that one was a real eye opener spending years clinging to the notion that college would save me no matter the debt or trials only to have what hope that proffered stripped i swore i would it work but here i am drowning in unmarked unexpected territory such is lifemy parents would separate if it werent for the fact that we are dirtpoor and completely reliant on my now jobless stepfather my maternal family is somewhat excommunicated and theyre hardly any better off than we are theyre rotting in their town just as we are in this wasteland my mother and i joke bitterly that weve got some multigenerational curse maybe thats just the curse of poverty and abuse cycles speaking of the day we found out may come our way my parents got smashed as per usual and fought fifth or so time now within the past year that my stepfather has stormed off in the night twice that we know he attempted to leave us and later shove in our faces how easy it was three days in and they havent said a word to one another hes gone all day supposedly at his parents place but we have suspicions that align with missing chunks of money no one seems to understand the gravity of my situation though my interaction is increasingly limited after a long period phoneless internetless and barely eating we moved across the country when this all started we used to move pretty frequently but its been three years i was homeschooled during that time and never allowed to leave our apartment no single thing can be remedied without tracing back to the roots of others hence why ive only ever turned in full bearing to reddit with it having at least a grain more anonymity while unfurling my life story than turning to acquaintances of course it lets me still keep that whole gdforsaken cordial distance with them what few positive interactions i have since i dont want to burden them with this they may get bits and pieces becausei am not one to lie but i cant tell them this its too much they shouldnt have to even shoulder that burden brieflyi amdone very done ive got my cat and my little brother but my friends are busy and havent seen me in years if at all and my mother iscomplicated she poured out all of her disappointments in me recently my religion my school despite having an offer and a huge scholarship thanks to years plastering myself to good grades my existencei feel so losti am not allowed outside havent been since moving here a few years ago and cant even afford myself a breath of fresh air i dont see the point anymore things will be getting better because legally theres nothing for me to do theres nothing i can take into my own hands no simple mentality changei amthoroughly fucked at the most crucial point in my life and i feel hollow alone frightened i pray november isnt it

1,cant live with or without her we had a falling out because of drama and nowi am not going back to her because of various reasons it hurts a lot to talk to her but after 2 years of friendship i dont think i can stand being without her anyway she is a bit toxic but i was going through a really bad time when she came to my life when i was alone almost all the time and she was the first person i actually spoke to in a while i dont know how to put the past 2 yrs of friendship in words because she really means a lot to me even though she was a pain to talk to at the same timei ampretty conflicted because i feel like i would do better if i cut her out of my life but at the same time i feel like i lost something really important that i will never get back again and it feels like it because in comparison to her everyone else seems awful they dont even want to try to be similar to her at 20 i have been seriously considering suicide because everything seems really awful and painful without her in my life i wont get her back so whats the pointi always think about how the scenario could have been different but it just makes it worse

1,end of my rope i lost my dream job in 2009 i havent been the same since ever since then things have been going downhill my wife and i stopped being intimate we basically existed and somehow continue to exist as roommates she makes more money than i do now and she takes care of 90 of the household expenses the small amount of money i do bring in goes towards my debts i have been unable to get past the job list 8 years ago i dont know why but i just cannot do it adding to that my health has gotten worse since then i refuse to go to the doctor and refuse to go to the dentist i just cant bring myself to do it instead i drink myself into a stupor nearly every night and ignore the pain in my mouth and in my chest i am now at the point where if i dont get over my reluctance to take care of myself i wont be able to get a meaningful job or make anything out of myself problem is i am so terrified of learning that something horrible is going on that i cant see past that it occupies my every thought my wife is an incredible woman she accepts my faults most of them and is incredibly patient i am failing her i have failed her in the past and if i am around for more years i will continue to fail her and fail myself i can no longer accept this i just turned 40 i dont want to turn 41 on my 40th birthday spending time with my parents and wife i looked out over the city and decided that tuesday was the day that i needed to let them all move on now it is friday and i dont feel any different family have gone home wife has a bright future i feel like i am just a roadblock to prosperity i remember when i was 19 and i was convinced that i would die before i was 21 i lived a hard life and made some bad choices back then in fact i should have died a number of times somehow i survived and prospered then things went off the rails again i guess this is what happens and at the end of the day i think tuesday was always the logical conclusion 
1,tomorrow i wrote a letter to my family in which i mentioned thati amtransgender and bisexual googled a bunch of suicide related things such as how long does it take to bleed out all i have to do now is to inform my online friends that i will disappear and might not come online ever again hopefully they wont be asking too many questions i dont want to make them panic i just want to disappear i am afraid to be honesti am not afraid of dying but instead of what would happen if i were to survive it somehow its all or nothing tomorrow on september 23rd i will hopefully finally die 
1,i always just use reddit to stall i need to just delete this stupid throwaway and finish the job before i convince myself to suffer another few months until i end up back here again its always the same

1,freshers week at university is killing me absolutely killing me for those who dont know freshers week is the first week or two weeks at university here in the uk lots of parties and events take place during the week or weeks and lots of people end up meeting each other or forming relationships i wish i could say that i either hate or love it but i cant give a solid answer on the one hand meeting lots of new people and going to clubs and getting drunk for the first time in my life feels good and takes away most of my sorrows and defensiveness but on the other hand things get much much worse when i realise what is really going on in those events and how much of a failure i amthere are lots of issues that i have so far but one of the main ones is you guessed it virginity and girls many websites and newspapers claim that one of the big things that will happen during freshers week is the romance or getting with someone whether its a simple dance making out or actually bringing them back for a one night stand many students have done something with either the opposite or the same sex sometimes both during this week or weeks and thats one of the main causes of awkward situations when you meet that someone you did it withi hate it i hate being a virgin even as young as 18 i hate seeing all these girls and boys whether they are already in a relationship or just met making out with each other or even kissing once or twice i hate having to make things awkward when i talk to girls or things not going further than just a short conversation though i fully respect consent and if they simply dont want to go any further i hate having to constantly be on the defensive in case they have a boyfriend or guy with them who will attack anyone who so much as talks to them in a wrong way i hate having to end up losing my friends to the crowd in the centre of the club which i learned the hard way i dont survive in i hate so much more of what goes on therebut i cant leave iti cant leave it because i know i will achieve nothing of the sorts should i try and seek out ways other than going to a nightclubi am not looking for a girlfriend at the moment its freshers week for fucks sake youre not meant to be forming relationships already because they wont last and please dont emphasise on this point its trivial every single night every single minute of me being in there not being able to do what the other guys who got girls are doing is torture its the worst i have ever felt in my five years of wanting to get a girl possibly the worst in my life me being suicidal at 11 was nothing compared to what i am and will be going through at the moment i am at a complete loss its the end of the first of two weeks of freshers and i still havent made any progress ive got drunk three times out of the five times i went out and still no drunken making out or hooking up though i know there are other ways to get with girls every time i ask someone for help they are on repeat here are a few examples of what they say and what i really really want to replyyou dont need to rush things b neither did the guys making out with the girlsi am not rushing things because i want toi amrushing things because i have to because if i dont do so by the end of freshers things will get a lot harder as i will have to balance lectures and activities with trying to get with a girl life is more than just losing your virginitymaking out with a girl i know that and just so people know i know its not going to fuck with my studies in any way i wont let it people have said that so many fucking times its not helping either offer some real advise or dont the same can be said of a lot of things yet people still worry about themthere are lots of people who are still virginsdidnt make out with a girl still not helping its the same as saying to a depressed person lots of people suffer from depression at some point in their lives its a subtle way of saying get over it which in itself is really not a helpful thing to sayyoull end up with a lot of embarrassmentawkward situations no hell to the no the same people saying to those who got drunk and embarrassed themselves its alright b they wont even remember it when lectures start have the audacity to say this to me there is nothing embarrassing or awkward about being able to say i lost my virginity during freshers week and it was great or i made out with her so hard last night if anything it will instil confidence nobody fucking understands nobody like drones all they do is just repeat the same fucking useless advicei am at my wits end with this it runs through my mind every fucking minute of the dayi am not trying to set up a multinational company become a multi millionaire or anything that i know will take time and effort alli am looking to do is make out with a girl like all the other guys seem to effortlessly do and end up taking one back to my place to fuck is that so much to fucking ask for 
1,i know i deserve it whenever i mess up i like to punish myself other than the obvious like cutting sometimes i dont eat for hours even thoughi amhungry my record is 22 hours but i eventually caved because i almost fainted sometimes i force myself to walk home alone in the cold and rain because i dont deserve warmth or human company when theres a voice saying that i deserve punishment for being a terrible person on repeat any timei amsuffering it makes the pain a lot easier to bearmaybe one of these days that voice telling me i dont deserve to live will become loud enough that i will actually have the balls to end it all

1,amabout to run out of reasons to keep going this week i just made a list of things that used to make me fell good and now prevent myself from ending my life and i figured out that now i only have 1 motive to wake up in the morning and it isnt enough i feel desperately lonely since 2012 when i moved into a new city and couldnt manage to make new friends only the few ones that work with me and even though they disappear as soon as i move to a new job the only connection with my old life friends and family was my exboyfriend but our relationship was a mess i dont even know if i really love him like ever but we went along for 5 years after my last birthday in march i just realized that he no long filled the emptiness in my heart and he doesnt even treated me like anybody was supposed to be treated by a loved one then we broke upnow i have no family and no friends my mom is the only one and we like hate each other playing videogames watching movies or trying to pull myself into social situations doesnt seems to have any effect to relief the pain anymorei tried talking to my ex again but he doesnt want to talk to me anymore after the breakup he was the only one able to keep the suicidal thoughts outta of my mind and he used to have some kind of mental i willness too so we used to help each other now hes fine with his job his new friends his family that loves and supports him and i am no longer any relief to him i aint even a good memory as he wants to erase me from his life at all costs but he got his almost perfect life and i got nothing but nostalgic sadnessi feel empty and alone
1,my cat died today my best friend hey people so as it says in title i was fighting with depression for a few years now and i actually felt likei amtotally okay last few months but today my cat died my best friend she would always wait by the door when i was about to arrive from work she was always next to me when i was home and now its all so empty i have trouble forming bonds but the bond i formed with her was strong i dont know how to keep on going the worst thing is that i could be blamed for her death i took her to vet because she lost weight and she had some parasites that actually started a cancer in her body vet said that maybe she could have helped her if id brought her earlier she always used to loose weight when she was in heat so i tought thats why she lost some weight but i was wrong and now she is dead they had to put her to sleep forever i cant stop thinking about how it would go if i took here to vet earlier i only noticed she is getting worse a month ago so sincei amliving alone at 21 and paying for living and school while working i had to put some money together before going to vets place i cant stop blaming myself and missing my little tina i always have this feeling that she is here i look on my bed and see her and a second later i realize its just my imagination she is gone i love her so much but i failed her i really do hope she is at better place now waiting for me like she always used to when i was comming from work
1,i think i m almost there i m really drunk my friends have finally passed out i have all the chemicals i ve planned to use idk i guess i really wanted to talk before i did it even if it s anonymous i m almost there just one moment of courage and i m gone 
1,anyone feel this way i dont have any reason to want die it is all just so pointless and none of it matters and we cant control ourselves anyone feel like life is pointless even though you arent going through anything rough
1,my 17f best friend 18m is depressed and suicidal and its draining me its going to be longi am sorry about that so a little background weve been friends for about 4 years with its ups and downs but in the end we still stick together he has had a lot of problems in his life living in a poor family sexual and verbal abuse from colleagues and death of his father to name the most important onesrecently his girlfriend broke up with him to be with another guy from his class obviously he now hates that guy hes had undocumented but pretty much obvious depression and suicidal thoughts before that but i think this has been a breaking point for himafter the breakup hes been telling me a lot more than usual about how he feels saying that hes never going to find anybody who will love him romantically that hes given up on talking to new people because everyone who he meets ends up breaking his heart in some way that he feels alone and basically lacks reason to live plus is overdrien with hatred for that guyno matter how many times i try telling him that its not true that he has people me and some other friends who care about him he doesnt listen to me and just keeps talking about all of this there has even been instances where he would outwardly tell me his plans on killing himself and i had to talk him out of it he would also mention the guy that stole his girlfriend a lot talk about how much he hates him describe how he wants to attackkill him even mention that hes had a dream where he shots him with pleasure they go to the same schoolclass so he even stopped attending it because he says he cant stand looking at him and seeing how happy he isnow the reasoni amwriting all of this is because ive tried helping him a lot of times but theres only so much that i can do i told him that he should see a therapist but he doesnt want to i try telling him that its going to be okay and that i will stay with him but he doesnt believe it hes questioned me a few times thinking that i dont actually care about him but i am still working on proving him otherwise and i think its slowly succeeding but i will be honest and say that its really draining me the way he talks about all of his problems and i cant even help him in any way every single time he starts talking about this i feel guilty for not being able to do anything usefuli amstarting to question this friendship because i love and care about him a lot not in a romantic way but the amount of sadness that i get from knowing how he feels just makes me want to stop talking to him sometimesi realize its probably selfish of me to say this but really talking to him when hes like this has been very tiring i feel like i cant do anything to help him anyway after all ive tried so i just end up reading about how he gives himself max 5 years of life because he says that after that he probably wont have the strenght to live anymore and how he puts on a mask and pretends to be happy it feels like its too much for me but maybei amjust the wrong one because hes clearly sick and in a worse situation than me so i wanted to know am i wrong for being tired of it should i still be friends with him if it brings me so much pain i cant just leave him now because he would get even more depressed and suicidal so what should i dohe truly believes that theres no way he could ever feel better or find someone that will love him he refuses to see a therapist because after his fathers death he doesnt want to give his mother any more reasons to worry i dont know what to do anymore thank you for any help by the way i am not a native english speaker so id like to apologize if the text is chaotic or if there are any grammatical errorstldr my best friend is depressed and suicidal doesnt want to get help i love him but its physically and mentally draining me and i dont know what should i do
1,is this normal heythese days ive been feeling down at school i barely talk with friends also since we are in different classes i laugh at jokes but as soon as i am alone i start to think of how i get hurt example when i stand at the bus stop i imagine how i would jump infront of a car and get hit there is something holding me back and i am probably too scared to do it anyway in the last hours i started to push myself to do impulses things like throwing my phone i am signed up to do workout but i am not feeling like it i lied to my parents that i went to the gym even though i didnt and now they dont talk to me and say what an asshole i am granted i am rude to my parents sometimes and now they keep talking what an unthankful asshole i am these things might be right but it brings me to another point i get angry pretty quickly lately its not that i have some uncontrolled aggression disorder idk the point is i imagine myself being hit and being in a comaunconscious but am too scared to be permanently dead ive been thinking about going to a psychiatrist but maybe this is something everyone goes through sorry if this is all ordered its just that i dont know anymore activities like programming or gamings arent enjoyable anymore to me
1,growing up i didnt realise growing up meant dying inside but hey its whatever
1,no will left to livei am not sure whyi amposting here in the first place perhaps it feels somehow cathartic to let my feelings into the internet without much consequence instead of try to explain them to those close to me and fail to do soi am so tired not myfeethurtfromallthatwalkingandineedtositdownandhavehotcocoa tired but sofuckingoverwhelmedwithallthethingsineedtokeepupwith sofedupwithallmyfailures tired worked my ass off all my life and still failed at life so monumentally with the wrong choices that its almost comical graduated with a subpar gpa living in a hellhole of a country where i feel likei amdrowning cant find a decent grad school with my profile cant find a proper job abroad i spend hours on end studying and applying arrogantly ignoring the fact thati amsimply not good enough i am just a massive failurehow have i come to this was that bright young girl only an i willusion how did i get so left behind how did everything go so wrongits my birthday this sunday forces me to take a good hard look at all that time that ive wasted and at this point there doesnt seem to be much to undo the damage i wish i had the courage to kill myself tried many times got pretty close on a couple occasions but obviously never close enoughi am not sure i could now either and thats the absolute worst its impossible to drag yourself out of bed in the morning when you know nothing you do that day is going to make a difference youre still going to be the same loser you were the day beforetimes passing by and each minute is yet another reminder of the life that i wasted i feel unfathomable shame and guilt for not trying harder but i have no more will to keep on cant keep up this freaking charade anymorei dont think anyone will miss me afteri amgone mom will be glad to have one fewer persons whining to listen to dad wont give it much thought and my brother might not even notice thati amgone boyfriend will likely be relieved to have gotten rid of the burden that is mewhy couldnt one just disappear why does one have to try and deal with a live shes not equipped to deal with why does she need to have the scars left to remind her of that

1,need friend i need to keep my mind occupied
1,about ready to throw it ini ama young adult 22 and the thought of living on my own with no help of any kind is driving me towards suicidei have no friends either as they all left or made there social circle smaller leaving me out
1,am going to die by the end of weekend and the thing that hurts the most is that there is nothing i can do about it not when ive tried every trick in the book to stay alive i really wish it didnt have to be this way and now i get to prepare my final 2 days on earth
1,i feel so lost please help i really could use a friend i usually am on here different username and would rather not share helping others to get back from the brink tonight i am feeling really low to the point of suicidal i am overwhelmed by a number of different factors and each one would make me seem like an ingrate i am not i really dont want to die i dont want to give into these feelingsthey scare me i really dont think i would actually do anything to hurt myself but the feelings are there on occasion tonight has been bad i am worried about my cat that is sick potential flea infestation on top of it all which makes me feel like a horrible pet owner and i love my two cats to death not literally dont worry i am also very worried about my husband who i got sick because i was sick seasonal cold i am still trying to recover myself i know that probably has made it harder to get out of this negative thought process i tend to get myself into sometimes late at night when i cant sleep i havent slept at all tonight i have been obsessing on things that are out of my control at the moment and it sucks like i said i wont hurt myself i am just having a very bad night even so i am posting here as a reality check to myself i really need someone to talk to i dont have a new therapist yet i have a great husband who really helps me a lot and works very hard and i just feel like i am a lazy burden who is keeping him from having the life he really wants but he says thats not true i wish things could be easier i am sorry for rambling i just had to get this out somewhere 
1,again i want to die again it s always again i don t care i don t want to get better i want to curl up in a ball and die nothing traumatic has occurred and i have friends and family that would probably support me through this but they don t know how i feel because i don t want them to support someone that doesn t want to change i have allowed the depression to become comfortable because it stays unlike my fleeting states of random happiness the thought of suicide crosses my mind more than it probably should but those thoughts have become comfortable too i think i ll eventually do it one day maybe not soon but i think i ll do it recently i ve come to the conclusion that i should die painfully because my life is great and i shouldn t be in this much mental discomfort so i ll die painfully as a last way of letting myself know that i am worthless and i deserve to be in pain for not seeking help or being able to fully take advantage of my life 
1,goodnight everyone ive decided tonight is the night i diei am going to take a bunch of pills a slit my wrists as backup i will let you guys know if it doesnt work out thanks for everyones support 
1,i want to use suicide as a means of getting my father to listen now heres the contextmy father was cheating with my mother by talking with a lot of girls on messenger aunt found out told my mother i dug deeper and found some other things as well happened 2 months ago parents still have huge fights everyday now back then i loved my father hes a very hard worker working from 10 am up to 12 am with no breaks and he still found time to spend with us on weekends but after we found out he changed bad he began being cold ruthless i already blamed myself for all those fights since i was the one who introduced my father to messenger but he threw even more shit at me started shouting at me everything i did was wrong restricted me from the internet and going out with friends i have to hide my phone every night for fear that he will take itbefore the fights i was depressed but nowi amdepressed to the point of contemplating suicide i cant bear this anymore he wont listen when i plead he wont listen when i scream he wont listen when i reason maybe suicide is the only way to show him the effects he has produced on me
1,today is the day while i realise most of my problems are temporary the pain i go through daily is not i really cant handle it anymore life just isnt worth it for me

1,i feel so empty right now both my gf and i have always suffered with mental health issues and weve always been there for each other for the past year weve been together recently however she decided to go to a therapeutic school for what could be either just a few months or even a year and as a result our communication has severely lessened she said she was getting sick of her mental i willnesses getting in the way of her life for so long and wants to do her best now to manage them so that when she is out she would be a lot more stable and healthy and that would make our relationship even betteri havent talked to her in a week and it wont be awhile before i do as she has to work her way up to earn more privileges such as leaving the school or using the phone and such and its been really hard without her i know how unhealthy it is to be so dependent on another but yet its so hard to change and i know i should be happy that she is doing what she can to better her life for her and everyone around her and i am happy for her and i amexcited to see how she will be as time passes but i cant help but feel so empty without hershe was my motivation for everything id get up in the morning so i could say good morning and talk with her before she goes to schoolwork now i wake up at 4 pm after being asleep for over 10 hours etc etc i dont feel like writing more examplesi realize how petty this isi ammad thati amlike this but theres no energy to change it ive been on the verge of crying for days now but i just dont want to cry because i know once i start crying it wont stop ive just felt and done nothing for so long of my life to have her enter my life changed everything and now that shes gone for awhile i dont know what to do its been so long since ive been alone that i dont know what to do with myself i dont have a purpose for myself i dont really know what to ask of people here i just needed somewhere to ventedit ive realized that i probably shouldve posted this in as i didnt really mention suicide at all here sorry about that i do feel suicidal but i dont think id do it because i know how horrible it would be for my gf to be away for awhile trying to get help and hear that i killed myself while she was gonei amsure she would even blame herself for it and i wouldnt want that

1,i think this is it i just finished my note to my husbandim scared to die but i see no other solution i am pathetic and my life is a mess i feel ashamed for being me i have noone except husband and he would be so much better without me i cant get help noone can help me and i can no longer help myself for 20 years i have hanged in there hoping for life to be better and yes some days life felt livable but this last year my life has come crumbeling down on me and the only solution is to end it it would be so muchbetter for my husband in the long run my depth will die with me my pathetic beeing will be gone all my life i heard how strong i am but i am not i am fucking weak i have nothing even my parents could not live for me so why should i yes both my parents commited suicide so did my uncle three other friends and my best friend and then i brought all this problems on myself by being a useless piece of shiti am so sick now i cant work or anything i hardly ever sleep or eat my life is hopeless and i bring nothing good to the table just being alive is not enoughi wish i could live but i cant i see no light in the tunnel i feel shameful for bringing myself to all this depth and now when i cant work everything comes tumbeling down on me i hate myself i hate to feel this way i am not strong i am weak as hell 
1,so i kinda went to look at guns today soi amprobably going to be fired next week because my work has been garbage this is just the cherry on top of a lot of garbage making me think continuing to deal with depression and severe anxiety like i have been for the past five years and my entire life basically nowi ambusting my ass to try and make sure i dont lose the job but i kinda hate it anyways and this is the second time this has happened where i am really close to being fired i guess i kinda came out of it while at the army navy store but goddamn like i was at that point like you read where suicidal folks get happy thinking they are finally at that point where its gonna end i guess part of it was deciding i didnt have enough experience with guns and needed to research it more or practice with one before i know itll be lethal like its still a very real possibility of happening me buying one my state has no waiting period and i have enough money at the moment to buy onei am not sure what i thought id get out of posting this i guess i needed to venti am trying to schedule an appointment with my therapist for tomorrow or monday but fucking hell 
1,i did a mistake ok so today at work a few co workers brought up suicide and joked about it a bit and i was in but then i started to casually explain the best ways to kill oneself and how i would do iti am21 and i have a very detailed plan for killing myself wheni am30 and life doesnt change to the better and one of them said seems like you thought about that a lot and i didnt know what to say and just went silent everyone looked at me in a weird way and i awkwardly tried to change the topicpretty scared that theyll tell this to our boss or other coworkersany of you ever had a slip up like that
1,it would not matter if i died 10 months ago i had some good times indeed but the times when i was at peace were very rare and i think i would not be missing out on anything had i died the thought of unconsciousness and void is still alluring it actually made me welcoming of death and not scared of it i already have an idea how to end it though had quite some time to think about that i dont want this its that simple
1,i thinki amdone i basically mauled my academic career in about 3 days and dont have the energy to put that or myself back together ive fallen apart so many times already and dying just sounds nice tbh
1,everything i do leads to suicide delete
1,i dont know what to say really i guess i just want to get this off my chest and see if someone can give me a reason to go on this post might sound like bullshit or exaggerated but its all true i dont think theres any way i could prove this stuff thoughi was born with aspergers ocd and depression ive wanted to die for one reason or another every day of my life as far back as i can remember i almost attempted suicide when i was sixmy family hates me both of my sisters would routinely bully me to the point of me wanting to die when i used to live at home my mom and dad like to treat my problems as a joke and laugh at me for being retarded or too much of a little bitch to get laid i would be physically abused chocked beaten head slammed into a wall and had my problems laughed at i remember being so sick i could barely stand and being told to stop ruining their nature walk i was also molested by a neighbor i told my parents they either didnt believe me or didnt care and hes been over to our house many times for holidays events or dinners ever sincethe only thing i ever really enjoyed was video games but my mom refused to even consider letting me have any even if i bought them with my own money no less she said i needed to spend all my time studying so i could get scholarships to college and i was ten when this started congrats to me i got a bunch of scholarships to a college i didnt want to go to and now spend my days in college year five so busy i barely have time to do anything besides study and its all for a degree for a job that i hate so much i would rather die than have to do every dayi have almost no friends and the few i do are usually too busy to ever talk to me i usually talk to them once a week at besti have no money no social life no romantic interesti am an asexual sex disgusts me and so does romance barely any friends and a family that hates me i can look forward to a life of working a job i dont want to work until i get old enough to retire retiring to an empty house with no friends or family and then slowly watching myself get old and then die with no one around who loves or even cares about me 
1,had my first thought today i havent been diagnosed but i amprobably depressed my emotions mostly feel like trying to see through waxpaper but lately ive been seesawing very badly i whiplashed today and almost quit my gym workout i got a wave of self consciousness and defeatism before i left my house pissed off at my appearance not being what i want it to be and having no control or recourse not obesity or anything but just genetic traits i get angry i cant achieve the appearance i want without a ton of effort i cant imagine how it is for women to feel something like that daily i will certainly never downplay their self consciousness ever i think i have a narcissistic streak that kicks in as a defense mechanism from accepting thati ama total failure piece of trash i know that i am not but facts dont matter when feelings are involved as soon as i got out of the shower after work i looked at myself trudged through my routine and felt totally drowned in hopelessnessthen i felt physically nauseous weak and had a suicidal thought on a treadmill i have no idea what happened but i finished my workout and i seem to be ok now i had a couple friends from years ago show up as they do regularly so i sort of had to snap out of it for some reason i wanted to explore the idea i visualized doing it with a gun in my room i wont go into the details not just because the rules say not to but i wasnt really interested in the effect on me for some reason my mind was immediately picturing my parents hearing a loud bang and feeling their gut drop through the floor at the suspicion of what i did then rushing over to finally see it it was less a taunt for me to do it but something my mind wouldnt let me get away with without going all the way it was a morbid curiosity that spawned from an intense wave of raw self loathing its so odd because i was generally 30 minutes before this happenedi think i just cant accept that i wont be what i see in my mind i dont get the attention i feel i deserve i ignored and i dont know what to do my life feels incomplete i dont know how to get to stage 2i amsurviving but i am not living and dont feel in control enough to adequately improve my life but i should be in controli am an adulti ama who is trying to be in the top 10 i look in the mirror and see 2 people depending on my mood balance i see a somewhat handsome man ready to take on the world and other times a man who is deluded afraid and hiding and the world by not giving me any attention is feeding the latter self image

1,why i have depression and what it makes me feel likei am26 years old i will be 27 in october ive suffered with depression for most of my teenage years and all the way up to now i will have it for the rest of my life its not something that can be cured only managed with a daily dose of medication that some days doesnt feel like it works i was bullied all throughout secondary school from roughly the ages of 12 to 16 it was an unpleasant time in my life there were a few people i hung around with and spoke to but i still felt like i had no friends within school my best friend went to a different school he was the only real friend i had outside of it i saw him nearly every day but i still felt like an outsider within my group of friends and even my own family i felt alone during school i was called names slammed into lockers tackled to the floor and pinned down i even had a brick thrown at my head once by one of my oldest friends the sad part is even though i was angry and hurt by what happened i couldnt bring myself to walk away from them because i didnt want to be alone i wasnt very smart i did poorly in my gcses after leaving school i took an ict course in college because i had aspirations to become a video game developer but i dropped out after a month because i knew it would take more than an active imagination to become a developer it would take brains and i was severely lacking in that departmentso after dropping out i ended up living at home jobless playing my xbox all day and doing very little else id borrow money that i had no intention of paying back off my parents and grandparents i feel guilty about that honestly i was always quite lazy i never really wanted to work but a part of that came from lack of confidence and rejection because i was bullied in school i had very little confidence in myself i was always doubting myselfi am not smarti am not goodlooking i will never amount to anything and i didnt like being rejected it made me feel worthless especially when i went to interviews and they said you dont have much experience do you my reaction was always how am i supposed to get experience if no one will hire me no one seemed to understand that i had a few small jobs that lasted a few days each but i always ended up being a jobless bum then one day my grandad got me a job with him growing christmas trees best job i ever had i loved it i worked there for maybe two years i enjoyed the work the money was great but it was only a temp job and i knew that going inone day my grandad asked me to drive the tractor up and down the yard whilst our boss was on holiday so i could get used to it he wanted me to reverse it back up the yard i did and almost crashed into the shed he lost his temper and yelled at me basically called me useless i felt so low that i sat in the truck for the rest of day and cried he was right i am useless in november 2015 i met my exfiancee amy she was my first girlfriend because i never had the confidence to approach a girl and ask her out i was a virgin until i was 24 i felt so special when amy agreed to go out with me i felt even more special when she said yes to marrying me two months later life was great for a long time then in march 2016 my job growing christmas trees came to an end and i was so scared that i wouldnt find another luckily amy helped me and i had a cleaning job within the week life was great againand then something happened i finally admitted that i had depression and thats when things went wrong i started taking antidepressants but i foolishly stopped taking them because i felt like i was getting better and thats when i started treating amy poorly i was nasty to her i hit her eventually i lost my cleaning job and life went extremely downhill from that point onwards i became more nasty and cruel i was snapping at her more often i hit her more often she didnt know who shed get next jekyll or hyde jekyll was the man she fell in love with sweet kind caring loving the man who helped her get out of debt that her exboyfriend left her in a week after we met the man who bought her an xbox one as her first christmas present the man who treat her like the princess she was hyde was the man she scared of cruel physically abusive nasty a man who didnt realise what he was doing until it was too late who didnt care about the damage he was causing in short he was an asshole but that wasnt the real me the real me was the man who would hold her as she cried herself to sleep who would sit on the sofa crying after trying to follow her when her mum upset her only to be told to leave her alone who made her laugh at his stupid jokes who would help her with money whenever she needed it in short he was the man she fell for two months ago she left because shed had enough of the abuse and i cant really blame her for thati am angry at myself for letting it get this far and for being such a stubborn idiot i never meant to hurt her i never meant to cause her so much painnowi amalone againi amjobless again because i quit and i am in so much pain myself becausei ammy own worst enemy all i ever wanted was to get married have a family i can be proud of and have a job i like so i can provide for them i wanted a son who grows up to be a better man than his father and a daughter who grows up to be exactly like her mother i have friends and family who say they care about me but i am not entirely convinced they do if they did my three best friends would have invited me to visit new york next year if they did my family would invite me around for a meal one night the little things maybe i dont want them to care so it would be easier for me to do what i feel i have to do in order to make this pain go away ive tried to commit suicide three times in the past two months i tried to overdose three times and failed each time ive cut myself too during those times i tried to kill myself i was acting irrationally because she refused to talk to me after a month of no contact she decided to contact me out of the blue and brought all these old feelings back then she decided to ignore me making me feel a hundred times worse because now i knew that she had been with other people since our breakup and she was out with her friends whilst i was crying in my room so i was trying to kill myself because i was upset over being ignored and being let down by her but now i feel that if i do commit suicide itll be spontaneous therell be no plan itll just happen i can already feel something or someone pushing me towards the edge i know howi am going to do it but it wont be me doing it i wont be in control and maybe thats exactly how i want it to be i love my family i love my friends i love amy i dont want to die i want to live theres so much i want to do i want to play the next splinter cell and watch john wick 3 but not when i feel likei am in hell i feel numb lost adrift in an ocean of despair and loneliness a man so broken by the events of his life that hell never be whole again and i want so desperately to make us both whole again but as much as i dont want to admit it i believe that ship has sailed and its never coming back depression kills everything your mind body soul heart family friends love and hope its the hardest thing to endure because only you can endure it people can try to help you through it but they cant share the weight by carrying your burden with you only you can and thats what makes you feel alone because youre the only person who understands exactly what it is youre going through its hard to listen to people telling you to stay strong when you have no reason to stay strong its those people who make you feel weak its those people taking your hope away from you by the things they say or do my own mother and sister have called me selfish for wasting everyones time when theyre trying to help me it pisses me off that my mum has called me selfish when she suffers from depression too and has wanted to do it herself but the only reason she hasnt is because of me and my sister in all fairness thats a perfectly good fucking reason to not do it if i had kids i wouldnt do it because i have a responsibility to them but because i have no kids no job no partner ive got not responsibilities so why shouldnt i be allowed to end iti saw someone say on another reddit page that its only selfish in the sense that i want something for myself and that its the type of selfishness that someone should be allowed to have which to me is completely spot on whats truly selfish is wanting someone to live in misery and permanent suffering just so you dont feel sad or upset over their passing it takes true courage to make that jump knowing full well that youll never go to the cinema again eat your favourite food again or make love again the only thing that stops us from doing it is the knowledge of the void well be leaving behind but unfortunately it will get to a stage where we cant quite comprehend that thats the danger of mental i willness it blinds us to the world around us in our heads were totally alone which means theres no one to hurt ive come to understands that life is a series of events that leads us down a path of darkness with occasional beams of light i willuminating the way forward its not the destination that matters its how you get there and who you get there with unfortunately the person i wanted to get there with is no longer around
1,it got so much better and nowi am in hell again i dont even know how to begin about nine months ago i first posted here i was in hell like ive been for most of my life then at the beginning of the year i decided to risk it all i told my best friend i always loved him we got together i felt like he gave me a purpose and made me felt alive he showed me the path to get out of hell i couldnt believe it in fact i lost it all after a couple months he broke up with me out of the blue via message and blocked me i have been on meds ever since part of me wants to destroy him or what he has become as hes not who i knew but rather a stranger part of me wants to destroy myself because i thought it could get better i could be happy its all gone in the blink of an eye i just have no reason to be here life is not fair i am so tired of fighting and for what i gave him everything and all i got as a thank you was to be treated worse than shit everything ive done with him was the bright side in my life i have never been happier now everything just lost meaning i feel like a robot living becausei amsupposed to not killing myself because of the pain i would cause to my family sometimes i wish my life was really my own and that i could just end it

1,ive spent the last 6 years living a lie and i just want to end it all hey my name is beau and ive never posted on here before but i dont think i can keep all my pain i anymore i feel like i should start much earlier than 6 years ago so here i gowhen i was 3 years old i was diagnosed with a brain tumour i spent 2 years in and out of hospital i didnt even know what was happening all i knew was that my parents were letting these scary people in white jackets take me away and put me to sleep i would scream and scream at my parents while the doctors dragged me away i think this is where i first felt that i couldnt trust people and that i was completely alone i got better after that and went to a nice school it seemed like everything was fine i made some great friends i still know very well today and i seemed to be adjusting well even though i joined school late then i turned 8 and everything fell apart again i got another brain tumour and this time i was older and wiser and so was more fearful than the time before i knew what was happening and i didnt want to die i wont go on about it again but obviously i survived but it left me with some complication my pituitary gland had been damaged by chemotherapy and so i couldnt go through pubity unless i had the help of synthesized growth hormones which i had to inject into my stomach every night for about 8 years they worked pretty well though i would never have grown an inch and id still be the height i was at 10 years old but i am59 which is fine with me there was one problem though i felt that my head was quite a bit out of proportion with the rest of my body because the growth hormones i was given were only experimental i was bullied a lot at school for looking weird and it hurt my confidence quite a bit but i never spoke to anyone about it then i went to college and got to re invent myself and it was great for about a year that then you realise you cant really change what you look like and even though everyone liked me i still got bullied by a few people but the thing that really bothered me was that none of the girls i liked wanted to go out with me well i know that obviously not everyone is going to fall head over heels for you but it actually feels a lot worse than being bullied because the people who are rejected you arent bad people theyre good people they dont bully you for how you look but they understand the bullying and thus dont find you attractive for the same reasons the bullies bully younow lets get to the title ive spent the last 6 years living with a girl that ive been in love with for about 5 of those years weve had an incredibly strange relationship we were never going out we never had sex we never kissed its wasnt romantic for her but we did spend all day sometimes lying in bed hugging and kissing each other anywhere but the lips i was extremely confused because i told her i liked her but she said she didnt want to ruin our friendship weve spent almodt every day together for the last 6 yearsi am not a person anymore ive lost my identity fast forward to now shes decided she doesnt want to live with me anymore so she can go out with another guy one that she wants to be with hes taller stronger and hotter than me you can read the jealousy in my writing but she is my world and weve been together for so long that to me she was my other half nowi amalonei amhaving to move back to my parent and i actually just want to kill myself the saddest thing is she doesnt even seem to miss me which lowers my self esteem two fold i think the main reasoni amsad and she isnt is that i know that the time i spent with her even though she didnt love and never wanted to be intimate with me was still the best i could ever expect for myself i will be alone now for the rest of my life but she is beautiful and so will be fine she find the things i gave her and more from her new boyfriend i dont know what to do should i just kill myself if the best time of my life is over now i need some advice from people who wont sugar coat it
