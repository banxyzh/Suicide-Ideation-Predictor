1,health anxiety prompting some bad thoughts in my head i have been struggling for 2 months now with some health issues as a 26 year old male my pessimistic nature just makes me think about the worst my hands and feet are currently tingling and burning i just keep picturing myself on a wheelchair being a burden to my family girlfriend and so on suicide thoughts come to my mind as i prefer to put a sudden end to everything instead of deteriorating myself day after day losing motor and cognitive functions life is already hard as it is and now my health is failing for the first time 
1,everything is okay but nothing feels okay i ve always been a bit unhappy as a kid too i think although i can t remember much of my childhood i dont want to kill myself but sometimes that thought just comes creeping and it scares me a little a few weeks ago a problem came up it was a financial problem quite fixable but i just couldn t handle it i tied myself a noose and everything i was gonna do it i was all alone in the house with my dog so there was really no one that would be able to stop me i didnt do anything but i felt like i could have done it completely on impulse over a fixable problem leaving behind everything i love and my hopeful future i feel it now too creeping up on me everything should be fine but i cant help the feeling that i should just do it like everything would be easier for everyone if they would just realize how little they need me 
1,ptsd and alcohol i had some extremely horrible violent stuff happen to me a few years ago i was 21 nowi am26 i forgot about repressed it or whatever for several years something unrelated one day made me remember everything it all came flooding back into my mind and it was like i was reliving it all and felt like i was having a never ending panic attack for about 4 days this buried trauma explained a lot about why my alcohol pornography cigarette usages were all insanely high to the point they fucked up my life and relationships with people close to me in signifigant waysi amafraid to talk about what happened to anyone even people i trust like my family or a potential therapist due to extreme irrational paranoia about the people involved finding out and hurting me again and sometimesi amjust completely consumed by negative horrible thoughts and cant escape them i tried getting a sliding scale therapist a couple years ago and even t and gave up on the idea of therapy i dont know what to do i dont want to give up

1,i cant live in this world ok its too much its too bad and too evil and i cant handle it anymore theres so much more evil in the world than good almost everyone is just apathetic about all the suffering in the world or people actively contribute to it people harass hate and kill each other for no reason people get killed by natural disasters and most people dont give a shit at all they just think whatever better them than me and move on with their lives 
1,why is mankind afraid of death lately i am asking myself more often and often why do we fear death nowdays back in the middle ages for example of course you fear getting in hell and stupid shit like that but today even if it is completly painless why would you struggle to just end it all i myself am not suicidal i would say even if i think about it more than often to just quit go the pussy but easy way why should i struggle with life instead of going the easy route personally i think its because mankind fears the unkown we dont know whats after death because none really came back from actual death and reported about it like actual clinical dead but is is really the only reason like i know i am not going to kill myself yet and it probably stays that way because i am just too much of a pussy to be a pussy if you get what i mean 
1,after failing once this is how i feel i wish that suicide was funded by the government i wish guns for suicide would be like condoms given to teens so if they are going to do it they do it right i wish euthansia was legal i wish that i wouldnt have to fear buying poison or a gun off the black market because if i get caught my life would get worse 
1,my girlfriend left me i hate college i have no direction in life i just want to go to sleep and never wake up ive been thinking about suicide a lot recently and different methods the only reason i havent done it so far is because i am too much of a pussy i have access to enough drugs to overdose on i live near plenty of tall buildings i am seeing a therapist and psychiatrist all the pills they ve given me have only exacerbated my symptoms i dont care about leaving everything behind because i dont want to hurt the people around me but why should i go on living my shit life just so others arent inconvenienced one of these days i ll be drunk enough to finally pull the trigger figuratively literally

1,children of suicidal parents will you ever get over the news that one of your parents committed suicide i ve thought about it a number of times over the years but never gone through with it thinking it would be best when he got older but the more i read i see even those in their 20 s 30 s struggle with a parent s suicide now son is almost twenty but still think it s not the right time maybe leave a note for him to be told it was an accident caretc but i feel that would leave out a lot i would want to tell him via a note left from me to him at time of death i would certainly not so it at home and run the chance of him being the one to find mei was on antidepressants for a couple years discussed with doctor a couple months ago to get off of them due to side effects with erection and i noticed i would be crying more often so it is not a side effect of anti depressants that i am thinking of suicide

1,i don t even know i keep complaining about my life because i hate it and i don t want it at all but i m here and i just want there to be some way out some other way without hurting anyone
1,whats the alternative seriously i have chosen not to die so many times when i wanted to and it leads nowhere i am already in therapy i already take medication i was already hospitalized 3 times in the past year nothing makes any difference i was kicked out of my schools counseling for using it too long my new doctor blew me off for three weeks and now no one is willing to see me to refill my meds two of which are now completely gone but hey fuck it i wont need them when i am dead right 
1,every time i come off my meds and it makes me remember whati amlike without them i just lose so much hope i know coming off my meds is dangerous ive done it once before and had to be hospitalized i recently got pretty sick and wasnt able to stomach my meds soi ammostly off of them at the moment and i amjust miserable i know that its just a phase thatll pass wheni amback on but it gets so exhausting and frustrating to remember that at my core this is who i ami am not able to naturally be happy my brain doesnt work right and i always think that in survival of the fittest i never should have made it i think its amazing i have but i am so young 22 and i just hate the cyclical pattern of being okay for a while and then it all just collapsing again and againi amjust tired of it alli am not surei amactually suicidal right nowi amjust tired and hopeless i know i will be okay when i get back on my meds but at the same time i feel like i shouldnt have to take meds just to be able to feel normal like most people are its not fair and i know the world isnt fair but its just a lot i dont want to go through my whole life like this but i dont know that i have any other option 
1,so sick of being told not to kill myself no one will help help doesnt exist at least not for me if no one will helpi amsick of feeling like i have to reassure peoplei am not less than two weeks from ending it alli amsick of googling and being told to call the hotlinei amsick of being told to go to therapy i want to feel like someone gets it before i go i want the horrible truth not the patronizing liesedit honestly whati amsaddest about is not seeing the end of game of thrones or hearing the next panic at the disco album it isnt enough to continue but felt like sharing
1,only 15 and boy am i done with life i just cant take this anxiety i feel everyday school is tough teachers are unfair to me my grades are under average and the few friends i have bully me everyday by calling me mean things its not the words that hurt me cause i know that they actually dont mean it its the fact that they want hurt me that does all i feel is empty
1,i dream happy dreams about my death and wonder about how my mind works ive never been diagnosed with anything other than some panic attack issues years ago caused by some heavy insomnia that placed me in hospital after my heart went crazy after 6 days awake thats mostly better now though i sleep almost every night but i am just curious are these the kind of mindsets and emotions usually felt by those in depression ive spoken to people i know who have suffered or do suffer from depression and it doesnt seem to fit how they describe itsometimes i get waves of despair and hopelessness when this happens i literally cant even imagine a future not even tomorrow it scares me as my imagination is just taken away and i am trapped in the horrible moment unable to picture anything being better i mean this literally too as in my mind is totally unable to picture anything in the future at all other times i go numb theres no emotion 
1,i am ugly i am ugly and that makes me sad but at least i am tall can i just end this
1,goodbye world this is it i cant deal any longer with my pain i am tired i was blessed with nothing in my life i am lost and stopped eating i am finally at peace with my decision i know no one cares and thats ok it just makes it that much easier
1,theres no reason to suffer if consciousness survives after death its reasonable to assume it doesnt age or die and is endless if it doesnt then life is restricted to the few years we spend on this planet either way there is no point in continuing a human existence mine sucks so why shouldnt i end it
1,i dont really know where to start ever since i was 13 i ve wanted to kill myself i remember the first time i seriously contemplated taking my own life i just dont know why i hate my life so much because again so many people have been through so much more i am so grateful that i have these opportunities and i wish i could give it all to someone who has nothing because i am not worthy of what i have thanks for listenings
1,life got fucked up by family so i was unlucky enough to be born with parents that were jehovah witnesses i cannot understand how parents just assume that their kid will follow their religion and force them to live their life by gods word i m thinking about ending it all soon although it s not like anybody would miss me as i have no friends because those are banned too unless it s someone from our church
1,i want to die alone what i honestly want is to be diagnosed with terminal cancer but not tell anyone i want to just walk into the mountains and shoot myself somewhere secluded no horrific body to clean up if the animals take care of it right nobody will really notice i will just pass out of memory as it should be 
1,not sure what to do its getting harder and harder to get out of bed i am only happy when i m with someone anyone i guess i just wanted to see this all written out my willpower to resist the urge to end it all gets weaker as time goes on thanks for reading
1,probably going to delete this basically i have had thoughts relating to suicide for several months to a year now i went from being legitimately suicidal to being a teen with occasional suicidal thoughts i am not currently in danger but i wanted some help i frequently think of what would happen if i killed myself i think of the personal experience the pain the person that finds me the people that may or not care about me how it would affect family and friends does it make me go to hell etc is this something to be concerned about again this may be deleted to cover up my emotions
1,sitting alone crying a forest with a bunch of pills in my hand i am so close denial rejection and my bad life situation plus extreme depressions and a broken offended heart would have started therapy in 4 days but then i realized in most cases it doesnt help and if then it takes years i have no zero motivation left and i just cant take it anymore no one to talk to alone since 7 years not even a damn hug ive gotten from anyone becausei amunable to talk to people and to go outside anyway i did my best to make it that long there is no more hope i am over the edge all bad emotions at once i m crying at least 1 hour every night i am so done no one can help me and the only person i ever loved rejected me i hate myself its too much

1,work again or check in to the hospital as recommended i always ask for a permanent rest and no one can provide or afford that for me its not really of value for people to just rest all the time my soul is really broken and i am in more pain than is worthwhile so whats your plan for me after all the therapy and all the drugs at all the hospitalization its clear you have no plan other than to just send me back and hope i keep working put the onus on me to keep functioning and thats a plan failure
1,i ve tried everything else i just can not go on another day i ve decided that i can no longer deal with the hardship or struggle of life and have decided to end it today i see no other way out
1,can i talk to somebody please i ve asked my friends if i can call them for abit but nobody is responding i feel like i might just leap off today
1,how to reconnect with yourself this may not be the place but i m just coming off of a 5 day binge and nights with suicidal thoughts for you what are some recovery methods you ve done to bounce back if you even decide to do that again i don t know if this is the right place
1,i need someone i just need to vent everything has come crashing down and i need someone to talk to 
1,i ve been waiting for things to get better for years i am tired of waiting everything is the same all my problems are vicious cycles dont know how to break the loop looks like i ll just wait forever and die waiting things wont get betteri amjusting thinking about how much timei amwasting ending things now is a solution dont want to live 50 more years to be sure all of this is pointless dont want to be a bad friend anymore dont want to be a bad son anymore dont want to be a bad parent dont want to be a worthless human being 
1,my mind is telling me to kill myself please someone anyone be the voice of reason i am so scared
1,i realized my existence has no meaning the only thing i do is hurt people even by simply posting here none of this matters i am useless
1,i ve been teetertottering on the edge for the past few months which isnt saying much since i think about suicide a lot but lately i ve really wanted to go through with it i am just tired i am tired of being tired and life is sucking everything out of me and i cant stand it any longer i dont trust any government institutions like therapists ive taken so many different kinds of pills only to have them fuck me up worse than i already was or just not work at all i cant even talk to my therapist about the things that bother me because they never understand or i could go to prison if i did my health is shit it keeps getting worse and the shit doctors i keep going to tell me everything is fine i just need to lose weight even though i already have a eating disorder and lost 100 pounds and i am not even that fat and cant exercise very much due to my shitty health i am really thinking that maybe the best thing for me is to not exist anymore in order to end the damn near constant misery i feel i am already thinking about how to plan my death including figuring out where my cat will go funeral options exit plan etc i dont want to die tbh but dying seems a heck of a lot better than spending another 32 years hating my life and everything in it except my cat
1,how can i stop hating myself if all i do is keep hurting myself i ve been hating my self for 7 years and its been getting worse and worsei amthe biggest loser possible and i regret nearly everything i do ive moved house eight times over my life i can never keep a friend my social skills are terrible no matter how hard i try to improve them my eye contact is poor or too intense i dont understand body language and i have so little confidence that i stutter sometimes and merge my words together i avoid even looking at girls let alone talking to them because every time i do it makes me feel like shit ive tried antidepressants they make me feel absolutely nothing its horrible ive tried various self harm and i once stole from a boots pharmacy i was doing work experience for and overdosed alone worst night of my life ive been trying to be completely alone this past month so i stop doing stupid things i regret and trying to be more positive ive recently completely lost all my enthusiasm i havent told anyone this i feel that if i keep going on this route or if i start taking something then i will end up killing myself sorry if this heavy i just feel like i could do with someone to talk to you
1,somebody please stop me i was so close today i couldnt swallow the pills i was too weak pain doesnt end it will continue onto to others that care for you i heard this before and i believe that even though they dont say it many people care for you
1,even with therapy and medication i want to be dead so i dont have to suffer i am seeing a therapist i m on zoloft and xanax and i still want to die i have the means and access i think about it i think its going to be good for me that i dont have to feel this way anymore i cant logically think of a reason to stop myself because what people say youre supposed to do just doesnt seem like its working and if i tell my therapist or psychiatrist thati am in crisis i am going to have to go through all this again and i dont want to go through it anymore 
1,am i depressed or am i just looking for attention i definitely have anxiety and i think i have some kind of borderline disorder when i get this way all i do is lay down or talk about how i should kill myself i dont think id ever actually do it because my family loves me but ive noticed myself doing it just to make people notice is it all just made up in the back of my head to get peoples attention
1,dealing with too much right now feeling very depressed and anxious also nauseous and might have to vomit entire night again i dont think i ll ever be happy as much as my childhood days my head rewinds every bad thing happened in the past a lot if i had a painless and quick method i would be out already
1,why is there no limit don t call it the easy way out it s just it s not easy getting to that point it s not an easy decision to make it s not a deadline i have 0 issue setting i know what it will do to everyone i love and the people who love me even if there s not many that s not an easy thing to do to someone by any meansi see it as my to be selfish the i put myself first and i only see everyone trying to stop me againagain i m supposed to do what everyone else wants i m supposed to keep suffering to make everyone else feel like they are doing good i m supposed to fight because everyone else wants me to i m supposed to fight despite it being those same peoples fault to some degree that i m even here in the first placewhy is there no limit to how long you have to suffer just because it s in your head if i had cancer for the 50th time wanting to just end it all instead of treating it one more time everyone would be on my side
1,when suffering is too great i would like to start by saying that although brief i would need a million words to encompass the suffering i have endured in the past 3 years i am currently at a stage where i am thinking about committing suicide daily and frequently at that i have even tried desensitizing to various methods drowning etc by imagining them in depth the level of suffering has increased to a stage where i believe that i could overcome the thought of hurting people that i love because my suffering has greatly exceeded it as you are probably well aware the notion of a parent or grandparent enduring childs or family suicide is unbearable for them the grief it would cause my mother who has has an unbearable life of abusive husbands and skeletal disfigurement is great if i had access to a gun i would definitely would have killed myself the fear of drowning hanging or falling is greati want to die i want others to accept that i want to die i have been looking into possible euthanasia i am close to the endif you have read that all i thank you that is all i ask
1,i wish i was never born i ve never been good at anything and doubt i ever will be always living in the shadows of smart talented beautiful people who actually have a future sometimes i hate them most of the time i just hate myself out of everyone i knewi amthe biggest loser of them all everything is always about money and sex and its bullshit i am just some dirty poor how dare i have opinions hopes or aspirations i can never have independence and i feel like ive been set up to fail someone like me doesnt deserve to continue to take up resources better spent somewhere else i wish i could give my worthless life to someone who belongs i hope i find the courage to finally end my pathetic life
1,i am writing my suicide note right now i plan to kill myself soon i dont know what else to do for the last few years ive been struggling really hard plainly and simply i hate absolutely everything i am i ve lost all my energy and drive and i dont care about anything i used to i am just another failure that will fade into obscurity with time its better to off myself now than to keep burdening the world with my existence ive come to realize that some people in this world just arent cut out to play the game of life
1,losing hope i am 23 years old living with my mom and over 2k in debt from medical bills ive been healthy all my life until i was 22 when i was diagnosed with a fungal infection some call it a candida overgrowth and its been haunting me since january everyday has been a struggle with feeling tired and this brain fog 24 7 i am starting to get answers to cures but all the cures have potential of causing other serious health issues i dont enjoy activities like i used to and i am starting to lose my friends because it seems like i am pushing them away but in reality i just cant find the energy to hang out with them ive been having suicidal thoughts often for about 3 or 4 months now becausei am tired of the suffering on top of this i was raised by a sociopath and suffered a lot in my childhood and my biggest fear is becoming like my insane dad this brain fog ive been suffering from feels like its making me lose my mind and making me feel more open to putting a stop to my life

1,will anyone give a shit if i just do it like i have nobody
1,i ve lost all my potential i ruined my own life freshman year of high school i was on track to being valedictorian i could have gone to an ivy league school i had such a bright future ahead of me of course i fucked all that up i went to ucr because it was the only good college that accepted me i had no idea that i could go to a cc and transfer to ucla i didnt even know that was an option my gpa sucks my social life is nonexistent this is the rest of my life now everyone has moved on without me i am a disappointment to my family and everyone i know this isnt the life i wanted its too late to be someone great to accomplish all of my goals i had so much potential i was a smart kid i dont want an ordinary life whats therapy going to do help me cope and make me settle i dont want to live this life anymore ive wanted to die for years lol i procrastinated on homework and suicide it looks like i dont know what i am waiting for i am never going to have the life i dreamed for myself i am such a nothing
1,anyone in a situation similar to mine 19 yo male in college struggling in school poor mental condition overall fully lonely not in physical state but in state of mind awful luck with the opposite sex nothing that genuinely makes you happy bleak outlook on the future i feel this state is pretty common among people my age in school is anyone like that on here
1,doing it to stop hurting others i have an anger issue and a carelessness issue usually i can keep both of them in check but theres been a perfect storm between events insider and outside work i keep escaping by having unrealistic violent fantasies about the people i run into i hate living in the city everyone is so fake and out for themselves i fear that one day i will lose control on another so maybe its just best to take care of myself first
1,lost and hopeless at what point does it make sense to kill yourself because you have exhausted every other option i ve had suicidal thoughts for about a decade now but i never really considered actually doing it until quite recently i am so far down the drain that i dont think its humanly possible to obtain the life i want a somewhat normal life anymore i cant help but feel that this is my final hope i cant keep doing this crap anymore i am either going to get better soon or i am going to die there will not be an in between anymore
1,before i die i need to tell my story this is my life its a long sad story but one i must tell to someone my life is forfeit theres no coming back from all this
1,i fucked up i accidentally sexually assaulted one of my very good friends i was in a terrible headspace and i went to go kiss her she resisted physically and verbally and eventually gave in the entire time i kept asking myself why i was doing this and kept apologizing to her but i kept going oh god i wish i didn t keep going i started kissing her neck and her thighs and pulled down her shirt i realized what i had done and left profusely apologizing she wants nothing to do with me now and i understand that but i can t grt rid of the guilt i feel like everyone hates me now with due reason and i ve been going back and forth through intense crying fits and wanting to kill myself i never have enough energy to carry it out but i amthoroughly convinced that it could happen by accident and i wouldn t stop it yesterday i was taking off my sweatshirt and it tugged on my neck constricting airflow very momentarily and something in my mind just told me to keep going i felt so at peace i m so scared of myself and what i have become every time i tell someone what i did in an attempt to figure out how to help myself i know they are judging me and distancing themselves from me becausei amabsolutely fucking horrendousi ve been going to class less and less and crying more and more and i dont know what to do with myselfi think suicide has been a long time coming i used to strangle myself with scarves when i was like 7 or 8 whenever i disappointed my parents because i felt like a disaster maybe i ll be at peace maybe she ll be at peace too she won t see me walking around anymore she ll be comfortable i want her to be comfortable i just want her to be fucking happy she deserves the whole world she deserves the sun the moon and the stars she doesn t deserve the pain i caused her so maybe if i don t exist anymore her pain will go away too
1,sorry in advance i am probably going to kill myself on my birthday i am 17 so i will be 18 if or really when i do it 
1,why should i get help if i dont want it i ve struggled with the idea of being alive and wanting to be alive for a while now i recently realized that i dont want help i just want to not be alive the only reason i would seek help is so that i dont hurt my loved ones ive attempted to kill myself before but i cant even begin to imagine what sort of pain and isolation that they would go through if i actually did it i dont want them to ever feel how ive felt but i just dont think that they understand how i feel even wheni am not feeling as depressed the thought of not being alive is so appealing ive always done only what others expect of me but ive never really wanted more for my life anyway ive tried therapy a few medications none of it has been right for me if they only knew how painful it is for me to be alive maybe they wouldnt be so insistent on me trying to get help i just cant wait for a medication or therapy to work that could take months or years every single day every hour every minute is so painful i just cant do it anymore
1,i dont see a point to anything anymore i am consumed by my loneliness and emotional pain although i know many others have had it worse i have bpd i realize its pathetic i cant focus on anything anymore nothing makes me happy i am 28 and have been like this since at least the age of 9 nothing gets betteri am really nearing the end because i cant do this anymore i dont have the capacity to connect with anyone no work i do has any meaning i cant gell the pieces of myself together i cant keep living like this anymore
1,i don t know about this anymore as i took my walk tonight i reflexed on my past i have been struggling with some depression recently so iv been stuck in my head i have found life hard to live with out purpose i m a 26m iv been in two serious relationships and i always seem to push them away with my insecurities all i wanted in life was a family but i feel it was not meant for me i can t take it any longer i unfortunately own a few guns and i spend most nights staring at them drinking until i pass out i feel it s only a matter of time till i man up and do something about it i m hundreds of miles from any friends or family and i m alone all i have is this sad music and my guns i just want to be loved wanted anyways bye
1,this is incredibly frustrating i am afraid of going to school tomorrow because i shaved and should i ditch school due to what happened between my parents or nah i have a lot in my mind i just dont know what to do anymore i am a shy anxious junior in high school with social anxiety 
1,i cant carry on every day everything becomes more and more difficult every night i lay in bed trying to get to sleep with every unhappy thought in my head all the thoughts are so disjointed unclear as if i cant think properly the only clear thing is that these thoughts are quite literally overwhelming every night i resolve to kill myself in the morning what is the point of living if all living is is a constant fight to have the will to live i might as well give up now
1,i want to so bad but i just cant bring myself to actually do it why do you want to die

1,is it really worth it guys i m really fucking unhappy i do take the effort to try and enjoy life but it is just not happening it s just strife after hardship after tribulation and i don t reeeeally see the return in all the effort put into it it s just the logical thing to do for me just kinda wanna play games that aren t out yet or experience new music those things are probably the only thing making me hesitate

1,after nearly giving in i ve made myself a promise last week i drove out to a local suspension bridge its in the middle of a park which is closed for the season and doesnt receive a lot of traffic the bridge itself stands 232 feet above the waters below which would be ample distance to reach terminal velocity allowing a quick and certain death as i looked down to the river below i thought about just how many people have been where i am how many of them could use just one person to just listen not judge or tell them how to fix their lives but just listen and allow for them to spill their guts and get that god awful pain out
1,my brain hurts and soul is sick my medications arent helping and my normal fleeting thoughts of suicide are becoming heavy i grabbed a rifle earlier and made sure i could use it with the barrel against my head please say something to me anything the anxiety is making my throat swell shut and my eyes keep welling up i feel like my prayers arent being heard and the thought of tomorrow disturbs me
1,i feel like the problem today is feeling real human connection i think the internet has made it impossible now your observations are very correct shut off the phone or computer go outside get some fresh air and meet some new people 
1,i really tried i tried everything i got a job started a study programme and i work out regularly and eat healthy i got over 80 of my anxiety and everything except of love is working out right now but i still feel pain i almost cannot handle and yes its physical pain like a broken leg just in my fucking head and its much worse than an injury i tried it all really i went to therapy medication everything i still relapse regularly i cannot do this i hope i have enough energy to buy a rope tomorrow i wont even write a suicide note cause i dont feel like iti am so fucked up

1,i am gonna kill myself i hate my fucking life i am so trapped alone and isolated it doesnt change hasnt changed in 5 years my parents are controlling i am 23 years old the only people who wanna be friends are fucking weirdos who want to masturbate to me and have sex with me you fucking losers kill yourselves i thought you were my friends you either leave me in the dust or just wanna fuck me i hate you you stupid fat ugly bitch losers why cant no one be genuine why does no one else care about me or wanna be my friend i m a loser and alone in this world i wanna end it all

1,i am scared of my own mind i thinki amsuicidal i don t know why or how but i feel it i just thought about and cried not sad cry or happy cry i cried like i m scared like i know i m suicidal but i don t know _ i cant think i m typing this now thinking about why i m suicidal or maybe i m just trying to get it out of me but _ i don t know i m scared of my own mind it s smarter than me my subconscious mind is smarter than my conscious mind and i think its trying to kill me i m scared when i look tot the future i see nothing there is nothing for me there i m scared i ve calmed down i still can t think but i m no longer crying i smoked 2 cigarettes and well i don t know i feel like i have no one to talk to i mean yes there is people to talk to my friend jake and my cousin marc my mom and dad but i feel like burdening them to tell them this or maybe i m just to scared to see the effect of telling this originally started out as a way to get my thoughts out rather than keeping them bottled up in my head where i usually keep them but i think i will post this to a suicide help subreddit no one can see me there i m just a name
1,i feel lost and ultimately stucki am not at immediate risk of suicide i feel okay right now but lately ive caught myself fantasizing about peaceful ways of suicidei am not even going through anything traumatic or anything but its incredibly unlike me to be suicidal or even give it a thought and i think its rooted from me moving out for the first time and not looking back i feel like ive made a mistake even thoughi ammaking decent money and am able to sustain myself with it i dont even know if this is just me being stupid and not liking the transition to adulthood i honestly have no idea but some days i just go numb and my mind wanders into suicidal territory not out of sorrow but out of a genuine longing to escape whatever the feeling i was experiencing wasim currently about to clock into work so i will probably stop replying for a few hours but i just wanted to get all of this off of my chest i havent told a soul out of fear that someone will just resort to this guys just being an attentionwhorehes got nothing to feel bad about not to mention its kind of a big deal to say to a family member that ive recently had suicidal thoughts anyway i appreciate you guys for listening to me mumble and this might not even be the right sub asi am not fixing to do the deed if thats the case go ahead and remove it as i will be away from reddit for a bit thanks 
1,failed attempt 1 month ago going again ive lost all motivation to do anything school work any activities even video games which i was completely addicted to only a year ago now i mainly just lay in my bed wondering why i even exist for hours on end ive legitimately thought about suicide ever since i was 13 with time this thought got worst and now at the age of 17 ive lost count of how many times i tried to take my own life just a month ago i had an extremely scary attempt i hung a piece of rope from my door and suspended myself so if i stood on my tip toes i could barely breath then i let my legs relax and swung them in front of me i was completely blacked out within a few seconds but then about 3 minutes later i just woke up for no apparent reason the rope didnt break and there was still full suspension on my neck but i still fucking woke up and survived i didnt leave a note or anything i just really really wanted to fucking die that nightthat was scary enough to make me stop for a month waking up with a rope around your neck cold with saliva running down your face slowly realizing where you are and what happened but now the suicidal thoughts return and i want to try again perhaps i should tell someone about my problems but theyd just call someone and take me to a hospital being someone who actually wants to die constant supervision at a hospital is not idealschool mainly instigates these suicidal actions i once cried for a whole night over the score i got on a practice test and i believe i came very close to killing myself that night too anything can trigger it i must just have a really fucking muscular neck because i can not kill myself via hanging i have tried literally 100 times now but i am going to keep trying
1,i dont think i will ever find love again i am 26 years old i am korean american but i really dont feel like i fit in either with fobs or americanized koreans ive had quite weird experiences in my life that has to do with religion and occultic stuff so i call myself isaac a long story that has to do with the name now anyways i am christian but not exactly a normal christian ive been quite popular with girls in some situations but there were many reasons why i couldnt get close to them i am kind of complicated anyways the other girls i dont really remember yet this one girland this other girl just not as much i dont think i will ever meet someone like that again i am not as attractive as i used to be i think she was my soul mate i wasnt ready and i am a failure i am contemplating suicide now i am so different from other people with radical beliefs and i am kind of weird most of the girls i know they dont fit me i would rather not start a relationship i can see going sour in the future honestly she was the only girl i ever met like that in my life i think she was truly rare anyone else feel like this
1,i 23 f am struggling with suicidal thoughts again and though i dont believe that i would go through with it its difficult to wake up every morning for a bit of background a lot has happened to me recently and this isnt the first time ive felt suicidal ive been quite depressed for the past year and a half at one point around 6 months ago i started writing letters to friends and family in preparation though i suspect it was mostly cathartici am not sure i will also note that three years ago i had a drug overdose that i believe was a suicide attempt but i am not quite sure i was sort of in autopilot that day at the momenti amfinishing my degree moving out am seeing a psychiatric who believes i have bipolar disorder and struggling with general feelings of sensitivity and selfhatei amcrying almost every day i truly believe that the people around me are sick of me andor hate me but feel obliged to stick around the heightened sensitivity has been the hardest hurdle as a small incident can make me withdraw completely for days on end for instance around a week ago my friend and roommate had invited me to see other friends but i had a prior commitment he said he had decided to go later and i said i might come too then and he ignored the statement and planned around me i literally cried about this for days and thought that he must hate me and must not want to be around me becausei amprobably a buzzkill or hes tired of me and he probably doesnt care at all if he didnt even try to give an excuse or anything this is an example of the small occurrences that have been setting me off and forcing me to reflect on my own lack of selfesteemi dont want to be around myself either but i dont have a choicei amscared of finishing my degree because i think i might want to do masters but my parents will be so ashamedi amscared of staying with my aunt if i dont find a new place to live soon enough and my lease is up in two weeksi amscared of getting diagnosed with bipolari amscared of losing everyone in my lifei amjust so tired and i want to sleep all of the time i dont have the capability to get through the next month i wish i could pause time and find a hotel room so i could just sleep and cry alone for half a year i really dont know what to doi amstruggling to live minute to minute

1,i survived a panic attack and feel proud of it these past 7 months have been awful since my depression came back ive been having panic attacks almost every night and its driving me nuts suicide thoughts every day for sure killing myself looked nice just to stop the panic attacks for oncehowever i faced it this time went outside took deep breaths i even downloaded this app called antistress and man this may sound stupid but it really helps and i could stop them this timeit feels so nice once you beat this shit i felt like sharing it because i know how hard this is to face depression face anxiety face panic but sometimes you just need to try a little and believe me its worth the try
1,i cant take being screamed at and hit any more i just got in a really big fight with my mom after she hit me and i yelled at her about how she doesnt care about me or make time for me and cares more about her canning she brushed me off because her beets shes canning are so fucking important and i amgonna fuck them up like i fuck up everything and then she said her councillor told her to ignore me and i am so mad because shes never let me have a councillor and she expects me to do everything myself and i amputting myself through college and working full time and its the first time ive been home in days and i was kinda excited to see her and i can hear her in the kitchen fucking canning beetsshe doesnt realize how much our fights affect me and how i cry for hours she started crying and now i can hear her laughing upstairs and i thinki amgonna go ahead and kill myself now because why should i live with people who hate me clearly she doesnt fucking care about me enough to just take one fucking minute to talk to me or even apologize so fuck you momthe worst part is i actually feel bad for making her cry and not accepting her initial apology but theres no wayi am going to say sorry shes never genuinely apologized to me in my life i know i have a responsibility in this fight and i have no problem apologizing and owning up but the fact that she thinks shes faultless is making me rip my hair out edit i was just looking at my last post about how much i hate her and i mention her not asking about my new job and surprise surprise one of the reasonsi am so hurt is she hasnt bothered to ask me howi am doing at my new job or school also i realize how much of a brat i sound like but these little things are killing me and i have no one to tell them to

1,the right to die in this world we live in every one stands up for their rights when they can we have people who stand up for marriage equality the right to lead the lifestyle they choose whether it be gay if you ask is being gay normal people get upset and say yes of course it is i was born gay they would possibly say people are becoming more persistent with their rights their freedoms people insist that they are to be referred to in a certain way sir madam regard transgender communities and get upset when they are not blah blah blah black lives matter white lives matter fucking this group that group everyone stands up for a cause they strongly believe in what about the right to die why cant we see this as normal all my life i have wanted to die i have lost count of how many times i have tried with overdoses one of the last few times i tried was by hanging only for things to go black and for me to wake up gasping for airfailed again other times people would always find me unconscious from the overdoses when i was pretty sure there was no way for them to and the door was locked and last week i took a whole batch of valium and alprazolam in a bowl washed it down with waterand apparently i was the one who called 000 and an ambulance i can get completely smashed with alcohol and remember what i do but my wife when she came home after the ambulance took me to the fucking hospital says that i had been vomiting in the toilet and somehow i went for the phone and dialed for the ambulance what the fuck i can not remember this is it a cry for attention no just so they can put me in an acute ward and i loose all my jobs that i do for a week and things just get fucking worse do i really want to die yes and no if we didnt live in this fucked up world of course not but we do so fuck yeah i want to die i am certainly not encouraging others to do so this is my choice i believe my rights just like everyone else thinks their rights are normal you can put me on all the fucking meds you like that is not going to stop my reasoning and thinking that i feel i have the right to die i can actually attest to this i am on them now so my question is why dont we have euthanasia clinics for those who see no way out and have lost all hope not just those for elderly terminally i will why dont we have those rights we lived in a fucked up world everyone screams for their rights and are getting them but for those who are suffering they cant choose to die humanly people dont give a fuck about the homeless those that are depressed suffering with mental i willness if you are living in poverty even though you work hard and do your best they look down on you if you are just a cleaner welfare agencies dont give a fuck if your suffering and cant go on there is no support for you while others bludge off the system and get away with it for years and years the risk of surviving a gun shot wound if its not done right and obviously how to hang oneself is can not work and cause prolonged damage as i found out we need assitance to do so safely humanely without the need for other people to discover you with pieces everywhere or at the bottom of a cliff this world is fucked and upside down

1,the grass is always brown i ve always been curious about death what it s like to fade out if anything truly happens after if there is nothing and living is all there is i want to experience literal nothingness in high school i was constantly in a state of depression and self harming i would make deep cuts on my thighs the pain felt like scratching an itch i couldn t reach and watching the flow of blood run down my legs and onto the shower floor was an over calming and intoxicating i started dating and freshman year became sexually active the scars and open wounds were embarrassing keeping me from doing much with women which turned a lot of them away but one stayed the first time she saw my scars she asked about them with a scared look on her face i didn t reply i was frozen she pushed her soft lips to my scars kissing them and telling me it was okay and i fell in love i then decided to quit self harm and months later turned to drugs to self medicate so to speak i graduated high school and worked at a pizza place and made some close friends especially with my shift leader who also would sell me marijuana i would work off the clock for him to improve labor cost and in return he would give me a discount and or give me a free pitcher of beer a few weeks later our manager found out somehow i was stealing alcohol and it turns out the same person giving it to me turned me in for it it was my word over his and i didn t want to make him to lose his job so i said nothing and quit arround the same time i was also going through a lot at home my fathers an alcoholic and physically verbally abusive my mother found out i was smoking marijuana and kicked me out i was jobless and homeless so i would stay with my girlfriend and other friends or just sleep in my truck at the river my girlfriend of 4 years went off to college and decided my baggage was to much she needed a break and wasn t willing to talk it out jobless homeless and girlfriendless i bounced arround girl to girl place to place put large amounts of drugs through my system trying to feel somthing other than sobriety when i was sober i was depressed one day i decided i needed out and wanted to better my life so i signed a military contract a few weeks befor i was going to ship to bootcamp my ex texted me begging for me back i was nowhere near over her and took her back with no hesitation i felt good i felt like my life was turning arround she asked if i had sex with anyone when we were apart and when i said yes and she hadn t it made me feel like i had cheated i feel guilty for having sex while we were apart and i don t understand it i went to bootcamp and 3 months later i m a marine i had broken my foot in basic so i was put into a medical platoon and it felt like purgatory doing nothing all day for another 6 months and suffering the consequences of other people s mistakes the thoughts and depression i hadn t felt months quickly came back fast forwardi amnow a year and a few months in i m currently in my final stage of training befor i get to my permanent duty job station i thought joining would improve my mental state giving me a purpose and somthing to do keeping me occupied but i haven t been more depressed me and my now fianc are doing great we have our small disputes but nothing major my parents couldn t be prouder of me and welcome me with open arms but i can t help but feel like shit i hate my life i hate living i m arrround hundreds of people every day i train with them i talk with them occasionally but i can t help but feel so alone and far from the people i love i truly don t think i can keep going and i feel like a bitch more or less for feeling this way when they re is people who have been to combat and seen things i can t imagine that have the right to feel this way i don t know what s wrong with me o can t talk to anyone about it or it ll be reported and i ll be stuck in holding for even longer and i don t want to scare my family so i can t talk to them i don t know what to do and i m slowly pushing my loved ones away i don t want to live anymore i feel like i ve made the worst mistake of my life the only way out is to do somthing and be discharged which would disappoint everyone i love so i m trapped i m not sure why i m posting this i guess i just need to get it off my chest

1,i like the idea of being 25 years old i will be surprised if someone reads this much less responds to this postanyway i have decided to go through with suicide and have made my plans vowed to myself and plan on retaining my commitment to suicide untili am25 years old why arent you going to kill yourself tonight or tomorrowor sometime soon this may be a question that briefly occupies your mind maybe not but its certainly a question that occupied my mind for some time the answer i have may seem weird or contradictory but i figured i would share it since this would be the firstlast time i will share it and becausei amwondering if someone else out there feels the same way or maybe someone canceled their plans of suicide doing the method in the answer i will be describingso the reason whyi amwaiting until i turn 25 to commit suicide is to see if i can make some of my ambitionsdreams come true i would like to try my best for a good or at least stable enough job to let me maintain a small apartment by myself be able to provide for myself and become truly independent strive to finish my schooling and get the degreei amworking towards even perhaps getting the ideal career i want then lets say i accomplish these goals by the timei am25 i would still plan on killing myself but at least i could do so with the knowledge that i tried to do something with my life its becoming increasingly difficult to continue forward with an almost 247 agonizing lonely and emotionally tormented hell constantly being a presence in my life i hate how my world has become so gray and dull to the point where everything i do has to be an act especially at this point in my lifei amonly acting for myself to attempt to convincelie to myself that there is some reason to be happy with my life some reason to keep moving forward i dont see myself finding such a reason to want to keep going on which isi amhere typing this post theres definitely more to say but i cant find the energy to actually finish right now so thank you for reading this weird lengthy af wall of text that ive been burying inside myself for many years

1,2 weeks from now i am going to say goodbye i dont know if i ll succeed this time but i think i will it will be painful but i promise myself the pain will only last for few seconds then there will be peace endless peace at least for me i dont know if its against the rules to post gruesome details of how will i do it but yes i ll jump on raging traffic and place my head under a tenwheeler truck i just cant find any other way a gun is way too expensive and i find jumping off a bridge from a building or by hanging being too cliche i dont want to be an inconvenience to the public but getting my head crushed is the easiest i could find at least it will guarantee my death enough with how i plan to end it but this is my storyill save you my personal information but so long as i can remember ive been depressed and suicidal for 7 years 6 and half to be precise since i wouldnt be here in october in anyway i started to develop depression after i was kicked out in the seminary goodbye reddit i know nobody or few would bother to read this but still bye
1,making plans to kill myself i cant succeed in anything i attempt and put effort into i am honestly running out of options and i feel the need to kill myself it feels like i cant succeed at anything i try and put effort into i might do it sooner if i continue to feel the way i am now i am going hang myself in the woods away from everyone i know so i can die alone
1,i dont know who i am anymore thats where i am at right now as i write this i ve been depressed for years now but the depression this time is different stronger i dont really feel down i just feel empty drained of everything that was ever considered me i rarely feel anything anymore or at least i no longer know how or what to feel things i used to enjoy i can no longer stand or no longer get any pleasure out of i have no motivation to do anything other than sleep and i only do things because i am obligated to my personality is gone as well and the feelings i ve had for those close to me are no longer there i am tired of not feeling tired of feeling like an empty shell unless a miracle happens between now and then theres no stopping me now ive gathered my materials and made my preparationsi amjust putting this here because i felt like i should at least get these things off my chest
1,derailing trains of thought things always get bad in the still of night and i am cold and i am getting incoherent and i am being paranoid and irritable and i cant get my mind to slow down i am thinking a thousand different things hundreds of trains on tracks fragmenting off into oblivion and i amrunning around trying to snatch up the bits and pieces of my sanity before they fizzle out its making me so crazy this perpetual frantic last ditch effort to grab these slivers of my mind becausei amfalling aparti am trying not toi am trying to handle it but it just isnt working i dont know what i think anymore maybe the truth is on one of those derailing trains of mine but by the time i get over to the wreckage to salvage some shred of it everythings engulfed in flames and ive got an entirely new set of thoughts dissolving away and demanding rescue this is so insanei am so insane you never realize your brakes are out until you slam on the pedal i could really use some conversation if anyone is out there 
1,i m going to a festival on my last day alive i got so fucking drunk last night was a huge embarrassment to my friends and ended up being taken home from a night out by police after i said i was feeling suicidal to my friend i am going to a festival today get my hands on as many drugs as i can and then take them all in one go i hate myself and i am ready

1,i am done with the loneliness and repetition i am not gonna sit here and say my life sucks wah i never get what i want etc but i just need to talk about this because might as well post it publically when no one thati amfriends with gives a crap so pretty much i thought that getting a job would help distract me from my depression but i think it got worse first offi amextremely lonely theres a girli aminterested in but i know for sure that even if i were to confess how i felt to her it wouldnt work out becausei ama garbage human i ve been seriously lonely for a long time and the only time ive ever had a so was in high school but then again she had autism so she most likely didnt care about me romantically then there was the other attempt i had at telling someone how i felt and she though said that she loved me left me to rot afterwards so you can see where i am getting at with being tired of being lonely all of the damn time theres that and theres also that i am an artist and thats been dragging me down lately too since i keep drawing but i never get better despite everyone telling me to practice and practice well gee nothing is getting better so it obviously isnt working i am just sick of it i dont even see a point in wanting to keep on living anymore because of my depression eating me away everyday i know i sound bitchy and whiny but i just want out i might buy myself a gun if i have to just to end it or maybe jump off the tallest bridge here in my city
1,ex keeps trying to prevent my death i dont get it i just want to die and someone who doesnt want to be with me keeps trying to make my life better i just cant understand i hate my life so much i havent done much with it except write a few stories here and there i am not confident in my future i hate when people leave me because they dont think i am right for them even though they say i make them happy and make their life better id rather make their lives better than my own but now she says shes so committed to preventing me from killing myself i hadnt even told her i had made plans to do it in the coming weeks i dont want to turn 22 and i want to die instead that would be a much happier birthday present i just cant fathom this why make me feel bad for wanting to be free from pain i dont see myself doing much in the future and all i can see myself doing is killing myself in some way

1,i wonder i always want to ask people if they would attend my funeral it doesnt really matter if they do or not i am just curious it sounds like i am directly saying i am going to kill myself right this instant so i dont but i want to ask even when i m not feeling 100 suidical just so i know and sometimes i feel like they should know its probably going to happen someday so they should think about whether or not they would attend and come to the terms i may die someday in the near futureand if they said they would i ask them not to bring up this or that its a little bit different than wondering if they care about you especially if its people you havent talked to in a while and its not the same as asking for help either
1,ama burden i dont contribute anything i just take and take and take thats what my stepdad said its so true i just take what i can get and survive i dont give anything i dont deserve a life all i do is take away from the universe
1,i thought i was okay i got a job a beautiful place to live had a great relationshipi amlosing my job and cant find a new onei amjust not good at anything anymore i am tired of fighting i am disgusting i wake up and the first thing i think of is shooting myself in the brain stem i havent been able to get out of bed in weeks now and my job is gone i have a degree in a field thirsty for workers yet cant find anything i am no good for no one nowi cant talk to anyone about my problems or my childhood all my friends died i am posting here because i know i should be but maybe this is just a formality ive typed out my note ten times already sorry for taking up your time i am glad there is a place like this to exercise my thoughts 
1,my life is a waste i m not really sure how much information is generally acceptable in these posts but since i m feeling this way for a lot of reasons i think it d be easiest to start with some background i m twenty years old and in my third year of college and i haven t done anything meaningful with my life i ve been ostracized by peers for as long as i can remember and i m trapped in a cycle of social anxiety that prevents me from being anything more than acquaintances with others i can t get a job i can t even get volunteer positions and i live with my parents and am financially dependent on them i feel like calling me a loser would be generousi m also struggling because i recently came out to my family and some relatives haven t taken it as well as i d expected one of them became very abusive until i backed off and basically retracted what i had said earlier about my identity before this i d been hoping to join lgbt groups on campus but now i feel like it would set people off and most of the people i ve met in the community are a lot more outgoing than i am and i feel really out of placei honestly don t feel like a person and i have nowhere to turn for support all i can think about is hanging myself and after at least ten years of feeling isolated and almost constantly suicidal i feel like i m finally reaching a breaking pointsorry this got so long

1,any event triggers suicidal thoughts any bad situation in my life no matter how insignificant it is makes me want to kill myself awkward social interaction being criticized by others etc not sure why this happens oftentimes i think something is seriously wrong with me and i lack the survival instinct others have since i want to give up on life so easily imo life is worthless and the bad moments greatly outweigh the good ones in quantity and quality so i dont care if i stop living

1,going to kill myself at school 
1,i am worried i m becoming suicidal i ve read and try to tell myself positive things i always counter it with something more negative thoughim getting scared that if i keep my mindset like this its going to continue getting worse and i am going to actually kill myself one day i dont know who to talk to though i feel pretty lonely contrary to my situation and i feel like perhaps i am pretending to be suicidal for attention maybe i am a shit person like that better to just keep it bottled up than to hurt someone
1,i dont know what to do about my friend so my friend and i have been best friends since the first year of middle school since then weve gotten really close and spent a lot of time together but he has never really opened up to me about anything personal one way or the other i found out recently that he had been cutting and having suicidal thoughts for a while now which he let slip over the course of a few conversations but always refused to talk about it further 
1,i want to tell her that i wont do it but i want to end it all so badly i want to message her and thank her for everything for being okay with the school asking her to be my buddy and sending me homework asking me if i am okay even though i could never respond truthfully because i didnt want to worry her but it hurts too much its so hard holding it in at times i just want to end it all i will never amount to anything and all i can do is hurt people no wonder all my friends left me i am selfish short tempered
1, i was going to kill myself it was so strange i sat on the ground next to the tree and listened to some music for a while since then my depression and suicidal thoughts are getting far far worse now to keep myself looking forward to something anything at this point i keep buying things off amazon i know it sounds stupid but it seems to work for now anyway i cant get to a doctor and i am not on any medications my situation leaves me pretty isolated except to go to college and come home i am not looking for advice or anything i just wanted to tell someone i dont really have any friends so i guess this is the next best thing 
1,i dont think i can do the life thing anymore i never thought i d be writing a post here i always thought i was strong i always thought it wouldn t get to this but everything s changed i guess my anxiety is so bad i don t think i want to live with it anyone anything that i could possibly worry about i worry about my anxiety is so bad it always gives me phantom pains and i convince myself i m having a heart attack or a stroke or some shit i don t wanna feel anymore i just wanna be gone i wanna be free from this pain i am crippled i am drowning
1,i just feel that i am not worthy of life i am tired i dont sleep i wanna help people but i cant help myself i really think about going back to alcohol or something like that to stop me thinking about it or maybe i am really newbie about happiness that i dont know how to feel about it thank you for reading this i just felt that i have to put it out of my system

1,i know my worth but whats the point of no one else sees it i am a really smart person i know at least a little bit about everything i dont know i ve always wanted to go to utah for some reason and watch my favourite show one last time all the way thought then put a gun in my mouth maybe watch it over 2 or 3 days in a hotel and then do it just to feel emotions one last time nothing makes me happy anymore i kicked drugs but i ve been abusing alcohol for months now do you know what it feels like to feel like you could accomplish anything but no one would acknowledge it do you know what its like to dream of something since you were a kid only to realise life passed you by because of your mental i willness

1,i dont want to live anymore the only thing keeping me alone is the thought of disappointing friends and family i ve had a pretty decent life all in all parents that werent abusive or anything i got to live in a nice place most of my life and my family has paid for many things for me but i dont want to be around anymore why cant a car just hit me then i wouldnt be responsible for being such a fucking failure what can i do
1,i d be just another gun control statistic i had the gun loaded and against my head i kept repeating every negative thought about my life my failures worthlessness and how people would be better without me i was in a lot of emotional pain and ready to go through with it it wasn t the thought about there s so much to live for or you can get through this or even thinking about loved ones that stopped me if was the fact that once my body was found there would probably be a news story about another death by gun

1,concerned about a classmate before an exam yesterday i kept hearing this girl that sits down the row from me telling her friends multiple times very loudly she would slit her throat with her exam afterward started describing the bloody mess that would occur i believe she was probably joking because of her laughter but would it be appropriate to ask her if shes ok and give her a list of emergency and other resources she can contact and what should i do if she says she was just joking
1,i hate myself so much i feel guilty for existing and its eating away at me and i cant take it anymore even just talking to people makes me feel guilty because why should i expect anyone to want to talk to me i wouldnt want to talk to myself i am such a worthless disgusting piece of shit i have nothing to contribute why should i expect anyone to waste any of their energy on could as well kill myself

1,it took me 10 minutes to get back here 10 minutes ago i was okay for a week it was because of my brothers wedding and in only 10 minutes i got fucking suicidal again dropped so deep again i am not planning to do it tonight but this could change in the next 10 minutes and i could be on my way in only 20 minutes the biggest problem is that there is no wedding or other event in sight so i wont come out of this soon and i was never as deep as i was before the wedding and i am really close to this again to be honest i m pretty sure i will end up doing it this week maybe today
1,25m havent talked to anyone in almost a year lost girlfriend lost religious beliefs dropped out of college 2 years ago i think last years have been a loop jobless penniless 150 in my name i cant trick myself into enduring misery any longer nor would it be an act of love ending this would sort of be the biggest show of love i could do to myself actually fuck i even feel ashamed for having written a post on suicide watch when i am feeling suicidal i cant even do a suicide watch thread properly 
1,a suicide attempt feels inevitable i just started a new job and its really stressful its alot to learn and i dont know if i can do it i am only doing it cause my roomates want me to take this job and its the only one available i ve also been informed that they dont really care for me i am just trapped here i keep thinking i am going to have to kill myself there is no other choice i have no where else to go and the only people around me have made it clear they dont care that i am struggling they call me crazy this would be my second attempt i dont want to but there is nothing else for me to do
1,there are so many fucked people out there and i dont want to be one of them i am alone with all this and i cant tell anyone about it it sucks it sucks living with this inside me knowing that no one in the world can help mei could tell my therapist but what could she ever do for me nothing it sucks but if its true its really scary since there is no cure or anything its just the way i am and its terrible 
1,i decide to live for maybe one more year i realize life is precious and that even though nobody care about me and only call me autism and fucking stupid little fuck that i should still live no marrer wat problems i have even if they make me want to go mad and cause a cataclyms
1,method used in chris cornell and chester benningtons suicides i know this is kind of morbid but given that crime scene photos have leaked and that both were exceptionally interesting and beautiful human beings has anyone explained exactly how chester and or chris committed their acts of suicide i know both of them hung themselves with simple household items in chris case he used workout resistance bands in chesters case he used a belt in both cases it seems as though there was no significant drop and they therefore died via strangulation cutting off blood or choking cutting off air not via neck injury i ve always been under the impression that it was fairly difficult to make a reliable noose using these types of items in part bc of the high suicide failure rate particular among women and in part bc i ve never researched or thought about it too deeply however the fact that both chris and chester succeeded makes me think that creating a reliable device is easier than i realized and that many failed suicide attempts are not actual suicide attempts but rather deliberate failures as a cry for help i totally sympathize with both those who actually commit suicide and those who attempt suicide as a cry for help i ve desired the courage to carry out both types of acts in the past and can see how one may do such a thing 
1,one of my closest friends is planning to kill himself by the end of this week his father is an abusive alcoholic and he gets bullied at school i am the only one who knows this were both 15 hes almost killed himself twice before both times i ve talked him out of it but this time it seems he has his heart set on it and i dont know what to do
1,i think i need help in my current situation i have no friends i am shy and have anxiety i am too scared to talk to anyone in real life including therapist and i planned out my entire suicide
1,i have accepted that i will kill myself i think i am now approaching that point i came to this belief last week i was at my therapist and i said it out loud i told him that i likely would not do it soon but that my long term mental health suggested that would be the way i d go that seems like a shitty thing to do to someone who is trying to help we agreed to break our arrangement he said he would follow up with references to a psychiatrist and a life coach having had plenty of experience with i willegal drugs and limited experience with prescription drugs i doubted that a scrip would help all the same he could forward me the reference i see no reason to keep going i dont know what to do or what will help i want an answer to fall out of the sky i hope that it does for all of you
1,i am going for a walk and i want to be hit by a car or mugged so i can die and make it look like an accident that way my family wont feel ashamed that their only son committed suicide it will be considered a tragedy realistically i am going to probably going to have to walk across a red light on a certain street that i know always has trucks going across it i guess you can consider this my last note goodbye

1,i have no idea the only reason i havent killed myself is because i dont want to make others sad i am not happy but i am not sad either i take other peoples idea of their own happiness and make it mine i feed off of other peoples idea of life because i dont have my own any relationship ive ever been in was only to give the other person what they wanted mei am so ready to give up because i truely honestly have no idea what i want out of life or what i want for my self i have no goals or ambitions or dreams of how i want my life to be i just do what others expect out of a person and that is simply to not give up on life 
1,unprepared for this peace to expire i ve thought about suicide and cried a lot todayi must have written and then deleted several pages of text by now so how about if anybody really wants to donate their time and energy to listening to me then ask me what you want to know and we can take it from there currently i have a reasonable comfortable existence for many many reasons my current living situation cannot last its with my parents i dont know of anybody else that would be willing to have me live with them when this uneasy compromise out of necessity ends knowing myself i think its likely that i will end up killing myself right now i dont want to kill myself if i did i wouldnt run the risk of spoiling my chances by telling somebody and i wouldnt use a method that has a chance of being interrupted or failing thats why its important that i talk about this now because i dont when i make plans
1,my parents are so strict all they want me to do is study and it makes me want to die have you talked to them about this you can bring it to their attention that this is a highly inefficient parenting method for trying to get you to make good grades

1,a friend of mine wanted to kill himself at a party last saturday at a party i myself had struggle with suicide in the past but i found inspiration in the unexpected i never talked someone out of suicide and i hope i didnt make things worse i just wanted to share this to kinda take it out of my system and try to understand this whole situation from different perspectives
1,probably wont ever kill myself i think about it as an option every now and then but theni amlike well from an honest utilitarian perspective theres better options than the finality of death my death would hurt some people pretty much regardless of any other circumstances so i can live with my unhappiness maybe i can dedicate my life to helping others nah too much work well if my life is going nowhere i could join the military but i keep hearing that its really boring after training work that they dont need a human to do maybe i will just do what i like hah like i have that much dedication just live and work to pay for my survival while distancing myself from others to avoid hurting them i am too much of a pussy for that well shit
1,looking for an easy out i have no reason to be depressed and while i have never been clinically diagnosed i have bouts where getting out of bed is the hardest task i ve faced my life from the outside makes some jealous single good job nice car etc but i am worn i am a caretaker of someone close to me and i am the go to person for many friends i am a good listener and i believe i have set the precedent that i can listen but dont need to be listened to now for fear of the effects on my job and personal endeavors if i admit my suicidal desires it would cause additional stress that would be counter productive i dont want to commit suicide out of desperation or even dark depression i want to just because its easy logically i understand why i shouldnt but selfishly and truly selfishly i want to

1,here i am again for some stupid reason i am still alive i am about to flunk out of grad school but i guess sometimes part of me is still holding out hope that that wont happen even worse the most likely outcome is that i wont fail out but i will be here a really long time as a pain in the ass mediocre student that the professors cant wait to get rid of i dont know why i dont just end it all now its all i can think about but i dont have the courage

1,a gun is surprisingly not that hard to get
1,this could be the end screw myself i am so fake cannot take this anymore i dont feel connected to the world or to anybody i feel like a distant observer not being able to interact genuinely whats the point of continuing and pushing thru when in the end i gotta suffer for the rest of my lifei amjust peering out my eye sockets not even knowing myself which is the worst am i going crazy or is this just another emotional phase all i know is this cant keep going on or i will pull someone down with me which in this time is my family i cant seem to let anybody into my life be close to a person even having a friend i dont know if the past made me this way having being sexually abused as a kid months back when i got better i thought i could change my mentality but in reality its just a character i want people to see me its fake i admire people who are just themselves they seem to have a soul and a life but i am just a empty shell useless scared and alone 
1,getting ducks in a row i feel like i ve run out of gas i ve been putting so very much energy into fighting my depression and ideations while trying so hard to help myself through transitioning months ago i had a week long vacation with my best friend planned we were going to gencon for the first time ever that very first day i had of of work i attempted to kill myself and feel i came close i was found by another suicidal friend and she with my best friend nursed me back i didnt want to survive and have been wrestling with that since i ve been crying and stuck on the couch since yesterday ive now cancelled plans this week and therapy appointments today i documented my assets and where i am intending them to go i ordered the second part of my suicide plan online and it arrives any day its been tough not being rash while i wait for the package and falling back to another method but i didnt follow my plan the first time suicidal friend had wanted previously to make a suicide pact with me but she doesnt know how bad off i am yet peace and i can only hope that those i hurt so much can themselves move on
1,i am still alive or why i cant die yet there are two reasons why i havent killed myself the first is that i dont want my mom to outlive me shes been through so much and worked so hard to be happy that i absolutely cant kill myself while shes alive i couldnt do that to her so thats reason 1 reason 2 is ridiculous i feel like i cant kill myself until ive done something worthwhile until ive succeeded at accomplishing something notable publishing a bestseller making a million in the stock market whatever something that justifies the fact that for a brief moment i was alive only when ive found that peace will i be able to die i absolutely refuse to kill myself now and die a failure id be fine killing myself if i were successful and theres that tiny sliver of hope an irrational hope trying to keep me alive by refusing to let me succeed does this make any sense good night
1,why cant i just turn life off everyday when i am trying to sleep i hope to not wake up it would be perfect i just cant understand so many things that it drives me crazy i just want to turn me off in a way that will not hurt my parents but even this is hard for me 
1,sometimes i want to end my life because of codependent relationship with nmom working on improving myself to get better job so i can move out 
1,why what s the point i genuinely don t understand why i m still here i don t see a point to living we all die eventually and nothing in this world matters why live a life when you re sad all the time and there s no end gamei feel like i m getting more and more disconnected from reality by the day and there s nothing that can be done to change how i feel i want to go ahead and get life over with it doesn t make any sense anyway
1,what is happening to me i am going mad i am not quite sure how long i ve been feeling this way but i can tell you that it feels like its been forever i cant remember the last time i was genuinely happy lately i ve been feeling extremely lifeless and hopeless time is flying by and i feel numb to that i am just going through the motions of life i have quite a bleak outlook on my life and i often think nothing will get better and theres nothing i can do about my situation i ve lost interest in things that used to bring me joy i cant seem to get myself out of bed in the mornings i often feel like theres a huge build up of anger and anxiety in me so ive found a toxic coping mechanism that coping mechanism is cutting and burning my own skin i am aware that its toxic and extremely bad but it helps make me feel so much better
1,its inevitable i wish it wasnt today is really hard every day is hard i dont know how much longer i can make my way through life i wont kill myself but it feels fixed and i dont think theres any way for me to recover and soi am in limbo
1,here not looking for help with preventing my death but help with making it happen please dont try to give me the dont do it stuff i think what you guys do is great but in my situation id rather you help me do the opposite i need help with mentally preparing myself and whatnoti just need that blueprint or whatever if you cant post it here then messaging me would work too thank you
1,tonight is the night i do it goodbye i hope you ve made the best decision for yourself

1,life is boring first theres indoctrination memorizing pointless information and spitting it back out not understanding why youre then left at an awkward stage after school not knowing what the point of anything is so you get a job so you can live on your own maybe you meet someone along the way who does the same after 45 years of suffering at your dead end job that didnt go anywhere you decide to retire with the little money you both have saved and are finally able to rest without worrying about tomorrow after 10 more years you die not knowing what any of life was for questioning why you put up with so many problems and why you pretended to care for so long and why you didnt just end it when you knew it was going to be like this at 13 
1,i hate myself texted my ex of 2 years ago today everything is adding up i moved across the country for a good job and i am still laying in bed at night wishing i could blow my fucking brains out
1,relieved to be able to say how much i want to die anywhere even anonymously even mentioning in normal life that i dont feel my life has purpose or meaning gets me pity and pep talks at best and not terribly subtle hints to stop the conversation or withdrawal from friendships at worst and while i dont know for sure what saying offline that i want to die and in fact have multiple plans with multiple pro and con lists in my head would get me
1,i dont feel alive and i am not depressed however ive been thinking about my future and whether its worth it i still study hang out with friends etc and i would feel like myself but when i am stuck doing hw or something late at night the thought of death doesnt intimidate me like i always have this thought everyone dies its just a matter of when u dieunless ur steve jobs or abe lincoln a majority of things u did wont matter after death this leads me to believe that theres no point in trying to make a difference in the world bcuz i will die in a couple of decades unlessi amsteve jobs or something i have goals family and friends and i am in a decent situation my social life at school could be alot better and i would appreciate less hw and testsjust a little ranti am really bored and stuck doing hw

1,feeling clear i have felt suicidal for around 57 years i normally feel suicidal when i am very sad usually thinking of suicide as a way to stop being a burden on my family today i did not feel sad i felt very clear i felt like the best option for me was to disappear i do not feel like i can function in society i am ashamed of what i have done and how i have treated those who tried to love me i do not pity myself at all the condition i am in is all because of my own actions i feel certain that my life will not get any better although i couldnt possibly know that honestly i am afraid i feel disguting in my own body i feel like every second i spend in it is almost torturous
1,still here all i am doing right now is existing and going to school and tricking my mind into thinking that life is worth living for such and such passions which dont even make me feel any sort of excitement or happiness anymore i cant socialize trust me ive tried many many times i dont know what its like to be valued by someone else as much as i want to live to get rich and find happiness i have come to realize that the journey to seeking happiness is somewhat a false hope kind of thing and i figure that even if i reach my goals i still wont be any happier or any less lonelier than i am today besides i think being dead is better than suffering through every single second of my life my existence is literally pointless why not put an end to this ridiculousness

1,i dont know what to do about my girlfriend this is such a tricky situation and i dont know what to do i started dating my current girlfriend 2 years ago we met online via a game and have been in a long distance relationship though weve met up dozens of times and have stayed with each other for weeks at a time sometimesboth of us have dealt with depression for a long time and when we started dating she was the sole reason i wanted to stay alive still it feels reversed nowadays i still love her a lot and she loves me but my depression has gotten so much worse since i started seeking help which i gave up on because my life felt considerably worse when i started acknowledging the depression and i am an even more negative person now than i was back then i think this may have pushed on to her and now we are just a rolling ball of negativityit feels like it is going to push me over the edge to suicide but i also feel that if i leave her i will be pushed over the edge to suicide because i dont have anything going for me if i dont have her on top of that it would crush her and the guilt itself in that would just fuck me up i dont know what to do should i just try and get over it and push through until it feels like it is getting better should i risk leaving her ending in a likely suicide for me and a possible one for her i am not even good for her i amsuch an awful emotional support i cant even support myself how can i support hereven if i did decide to break it off with her i have no idea how this is the first and only relationship ive ever been in and i really dont think id ever find someone else that would be willing to be with me that i also like but putting future possible relationships aside if i continue living to even have a second i dont know what i should do about this oneim so lost and confused and i dont know what i can do about it please help mei am sorry i came here instead of or but they wouldnt understand the depression situation like i feel a lot of you would

1,i posted on here 19 days ago and very little has changed things have slowly gone downhill despite all thats happened in the past 19 days id say two weeks within those 19 days were fairly unforgettable but i genuinely miss the circumstances in which those two really three and a half weeks were spent the only person i have really any true feelings for is quite hard to get through despite what i vaguely know i dont even know how they truly feel about me part of me says why bother but i know i cant regardless the past fourfive days have been almost a blur ive gone out for walks everyday for five six hours at a time i still feel manage to feel worse i keep coming to the same conclusioni am not sure why i even bother waking up theres a quote by vladimir lenin i read thats stuck with me it seems very relevant but i still dont know no matter what i do or try whats the point just offing myself seems the best option theres very little for me to do other wise suicide amongst a few important things is the only thing on my mind its very tempting at this point
1,why am i so sad 247 halfway past high school i started feeling this way but since my mother doesn t really believe in psicological i willness i ve never really tried to figure out what was wrong now i m a freshman in college and things were getting better related to that subject but since summer everything just got worst i have suicidal thoughts again like do i really matter people would even notice if i m not around would they even care do they care my boyfriend is super worried about me only because we end up fight in my crisis and they affect him so how but he never even asks me if i m okay i end up crying almost every day everything always gets so blue somehow sometimes because of the fights but mostly everything gets so confusing and overwhelming in my head that i can t help to be mad or cry usually both i want help but will a talk with a psychiatrist really help he will give me medication but they can make things worst not better

1,that voice inside your head what does it say to youi ve been in counseling and heard it described as intrusive thoughts and inner monologue it s suggested that the voicevoices and phrases you constantly repeat in your head is depression itself almost like a separate entityi m curious what phrases other people hear when they are in their lowest state here are some of minepeople would be better off without you you re nothing it will only get worse you only cause others pain you re a failure you re worthless just give up you deserve to die life is not worth it anymore what s the pointso what are some other things that run through your mind when you are seriously contemplating suicide perhaps if we see others going through something similar it can help us all know we are not alone

1,always praying and wishing for death this is going to be long i dont know what to do or where to go ive never felt so lost in my life and i know all the sequence of events that got me here but i was too young to control them and the adults around me too foolish to see themi dont know what i want from writing this but i need to vent ive cried myself to sleep the last few nights and i only want to die i only want deaths sweet embraceif i dig deep back to my earliest memory its me eating a bowl of corn flakes with orange juice there is no earlier memory this was before prek age 4 it was only when i started going to preschool that i realized something was differentparents talked to their kids they hugged them they laughed with them they told them that they love them it blew my 4 year old mind wide open my parents didnt do that my eyes are getting waterymy parents never hugged me never told me they loved me and never gave me affection by any standard in the united states at least i felt no love growing up and watching the people around me it hurti have 3 older siblings our age gaps range from 410 years we grew up like strangers because of our parents yet we lived in the same house my two older brothers always treated me like shit and i was the punching bag i always got the worst of it i never really spoke to them growing upat school i didnt make too many friends i think by the time i hit first grade i was already broken i had no one to talk to at home my parents frequently beat me with wooden spoons hot pans belts metal side too flip flops fists etc my siblings beat mei dont remember having friends i remember loneliness and crippling depressionin 7th grade i was introduced to public school in a new state it was my first time going to public school being brown i was called a terrorist immediately and bullied i tried to defend myself but i was scrawny and weak i used to have so much patience at this time in my lifeit was slowly erodedat school it was just bullying and harassment at home it was just bullying and harassment bullied by peers parents and siblings i only wanted to die i knew i wanted death for a long time at this point but i was too scared i held a knife to myself many times but i was always too scaredi went through middle school and high school creating a facade that i was happy that i wasnt suffering from crippling depression everyone believed it including my family through middle school and high school i probably cried myself to sleep almost every night i had giant bags under my eyes which i still have to this day at 24 i would pray to god on a daily basis to kill me to end it all or help me end it all i went to a private catholic school before 7th grade and being young and impressionable i really believe in life after death i believe suicide will send me to hell which is somewhere i dont want to go i suffered so much in this life already how can i kill myself and go somewhere to suffer for eternity i dont know what i want out of writing this but i just really want to die so badlyi felt better in college i felt less alone but even having a gf or a few friends i still felt itmy baseline emotion at this point was crippling depressioni realized i dont know how to actually make friends i have had so so very few friends in my life i have no one to talk to and loneliness is killing meno one really knows but i partially joined the military after college in hopes of finding that connection people speak ofim looking for that now and i realize its just like anywhere else i still have trouble making friends and i really dont know how to fix it some people i just click with maybe like 1 out of 500 and the rest i just dont have anything to talk about i dont know what to say i dont want watch any sports i dont like that stuffi amweird and i always try and keep that happy facade uplately the loneliness and stress have just been adding up that i cant help but cry myself to sleep i just want a friend i just want someone to talk to i just want to die i pray to god that i can get into some kind of car accident where only i will get hurt and die i pray i can die in my sleep i pray to have a heart attack to get cancer to die some sudden death or get run over i pray that god takes the breath from my lungsi dont love anyone on this planet i have no desire to stay here i have no attachments all ive ever wanted in this life is to have my own family someone to love that loves me back and children to raise properly a real family not the bullshit hand i was dealtbut its hardmy parents let me eat like garbage growing up we never went out to eat but all i really ate was cheese and pasta my body never properly developed if you look closely my head is smaller than most males as is whats between my legs they are both closer to a childs my body even though people thinki ammuscular is soft and pudgy i am undeveloped my emotions are a mess my mind is a mess i dont know what to do with my lifei dont know whyi amwriting this or what i want i just know that if i was offered the opportunity to die i would take it in a heartbeat the only thing that stops me from killing myself is the fear i will go to hell but oh my goshi wish someone would kill me the loneliness and pain in my heart is so crippling it hurts living each day everyday i stop caring about hell just a little bit because i want to leave this world i want the pain to end i want the torrent of emotions in my mind to stopedit i think i know what i want i mean i want friends i want people to talk i want to be normal but i know that takes timefor a while i used to be good at taking my mind off these things and finding an escape but the crippling depression and desire to die has become too overwhelming it invades my every thought i want to know how i can get out of this i want it to stop until death can find me until i die i need these thoughts to be gone i know thats whats good for me but its just so hard when pain and mental despair is all you know
1,this is cross posted from the depression sub and also just because right nowi am not doing so well this is my storyi am34 years old and i have lived with depression for the last 18 years of my life each year it gets worse and worse there are days where i just do not want to get out of bed there are days wheni amoff from work that i do not get out of bed i just lay in bed eat junk and just watch tv or youtube all day long and frankly that is just what i want to do with my time off i dont want to do anything that is extra work i just feel drained and lazy most of the time from my depressionit hurts and what hurts even more is that i do not have anyone in my real life that seems to care i have come out with saying that i am depressed and all i got from my mother wasi am sorry you are sad sadness and depression are two different things she doesnt understand and she is not willing to understand she told me to snap out of it i cant snap out of itmy depression about four years ago really took a nose dive it got horrible and that was the day i learned about mom and dad getting a divorce they told me about it first thing in the morning on my 30th birthday it hurt it hurt a lot to tell me first thing in the morning about it all she didnt stop there she decided to tell me all about my dads new girlfriend and that i also had a new half brotheri felt rotten that entire day this is where people look at me really funny but i found something later that day that did make me happy and something that did make me smile or should i say someonei came home from work and i turned the tv on i sat there for a few moments in this kind of trance because i still couldnt believe what was going on in my life i was suddenly snapped out of that trance as i looked back at the tv the colbert report came on i had never seen it before so i gave it a shot the first thing that ran through my mind was oh he is cute but then later on as i watched it more i began to laugh and smile that was the first time i had smiled that day and in a long time i started to look forward to that feeling every daynow you may laugh at me plenty do ive been called weird and crazy for it franklyi amat the point now that i dont care that is the only thing i have to look forward to every day that is the only thing that keeps me going through the day is getting home and watching him before i go to bedafter a while i did develop a crush go figure anyways on to more about my adventures here i started to get a little bold and i would go to the dirty role playing subs here i would post ads for role plays of where i would want people to play him and help me play out some of my fantasies because i enjoyed that feeling and also it was just something else to engage my brain in something that kept me focused on something i like and not thinking about my depression more and feeling badbut that didnt work out the way that i wanted to it only gained the attention of trolls and they trolled me hard to so hard thati amnow banned from those subs they ruined something that i loved something that gave me a fucking reason to live because my fucking parents sure as hell dont do thathell this post might attract trolls and i know that was just an invite to be honest ive been crying as ive been writing out this post i was told by someone to just start a post here and just write write whatever came to my mind so here it is take it or leave it read it or ignore it laugh at me or dont chances are someone already has

1,boiling over ive always been very personal and private about my depression and anxiety i always wanted to keep it all to myself and maybe i could help someone by sharing my story but the time for that has never comei am not embarrassed of what ive done rather scared that no one would be able to look at me the same if they knew the first time i really tried to kill myself i took a handful of oxy and went for a drive expecting not to be able to react it was between 13am on a weekday in 2014 i drove my favorite canyon road by the time i got to the end of the road everything went black and i woke up a few hours later pulled over safelyi am not sure why i pulled over or why i didnt just let myself crash but i didnt the next year i spent most every day on some kind of hard drug intermittently trying to od but it never worked then january 5th of 2015 after a terrible acid trip and even more terrible interaction with people i thought cared about me i tried to end my life i wrote 6 letters to my sister my mom my dad and my 3 closest friends i snorted half a gram of ketamine drank 13 of a bottle of fireball and took all the valium that was prescribed to me that month about 60 pills and slit both my wrists i was living at home with my parents after dropping out of college my dad travels 3 or more weeks out of every month and my mom was staying with my grandmother who was dying and if my dad had time off hed stay with them in california and leave me with the house to myself my parents never knew of my addiction or how bad i had gotten back to january 5th my parents were home but used to me not leaving my room for days at a time and my mom busts into my room at around 3pm on the 7th and pulls open my blinds and yells that its time for me to do something anything and storms out of my room slamming my door and as unlikely as it may seem i came to my sheets were bloody the letters still sat on my night table next to my bed and my mom didnt even look at me or the slew of drugs and alcohol on my night table the only thing i remember from my attempted suicide was becoming very cold and seeing nothing but black until i saw just my own face emerging from the blackness i didnt interact with myself i didnt say anything or rather dont remember saying anything and the peaceful darkness of me staring at my own face in darkness was interrupted by my moms voice of her barging in my room for the next 4 months i went back to school and wore long sleeve shirts well into spring break when i finally slipped my family and i went out for family dinner and i wore a long sleeve sweater and as i reached across the table to grab something my mom saw my scarred wrist i had been waiting for them to heal enough so that i could get a tattoo to cover them up but they were badly scarred and unsightly i never told anyone what happened that night other than telling my mom i tried to kill my self months earlier i have never been afraid of death nor the repercussions of killing myself until my family sat me down and each of them told me how it would have affected them and how it would affect everyone that knew me this didnt scare me but made me feel terrible made me feel even more like a burden and i knew id never be able to escape their fears of me attempting again for the next year i got daily check ins from my family which inevitably slowed as the year progressed and finally the anniversary was upon me again and overwhelmed with emotion i attempted again however this time i just tried to od on sleeping meds and barbiturates i had been living with my best friends and their girlfriends in a house near my school and when i attempted i believe this was the closest i got to death i started having extreme trouble breathing my heart was racing my vision was blurry and i was terrified i made a last ditch effort to throw up some pills after i made myself throw up i passed out in my shower in my room again never told anyone and no one was the wiser that this had just occurredi am not sure how i could help anyone with this story but i always hoped that maybe i could help someone feeling like they cant go on like they are afraid every day that they could take their own life but the truth is i still feel that way after all the therapy ive gone through after all the experiences that have gotten me here i still have a daily thought about how id do it again about how i wont fail next time all the while trying to be there for my friends in their times of weakness and there for my family to try and be the goofy light hearted sonbrother theyd known its just not me anymore and its lonely knowing i have to keep these things to myself so i dont scare or put stress on those around me on those who still care about me 
1,me again not looking to be talked out of it this time i posted here before and was convinced not to end it allowing myself to be convinced was a mistake there are cliffs not far from where i live and i plan to throw myself off them at some point within the next week not looking to be talked out of it just wanted to tell someone whats happening 26 years is long enough and my relatives and friends will no doubt be much happier oncei amno longer there to burden them
1,everything was going so well i didnt hardly have anything to eat last payday i had enough to eat and have gas to get back an forth to work all this payday because i was getting caught up on bills my car loan company took the money out a week early so now i have no food to eat they gave me the we apologize for the glitch in our system but we dont issue refunds i told them i would report it to my bank as fraud then a supervisor got on and said if i did then if i was ever late again they would repo my car so here i sit with no food again looking at a knife and thinking about ending it all i just think about how nice it was last week eating three meals everyday i wanted to go to the food bank but they were only open till 11am and i had to work they dont open till tuesday and close before i get off of work i cant stand going hungry any more i dont know what to do
1,i am alone i have a gun i need a dog my husband is out of town to meet up with some of his fraternity brothers for a football game at their alma mater no pets no kids i am too ashamed of my feelings to call anyone i am okay 80 of the time but i suffer from sporadic bouts of depression that include really intense suicidal thoughtsurges there is a loaded gun in the top drawer of my nightstand for protection my kitchen is full of knives my medicine cabinet has an industrial sized bottle of ibuprofen the liquor cabinet and wine rack hold enough for more than one person i have only told my husband about these feelings once i didnt want to he was driving us to family dinner at my parents house a little ways away and i started feeling the overwhelming sense of uselessness and wishing i didnt exist while looking at the cement construction barrier to my right i was taking deep breaths to calm myself but that isnt an instant fix the tears started pouring down my face and my husband not the most observant although super loving and supportive noticed he thought hed done something wrong he was worried i told him oh its stupid sometimes i get overwhelmed with feelings of uselessness and i feel like the world would be way better without me in it i will be fine it just takes awhile for these feelings to go away he assured me loves me and he would be devastated if anything ever happened to me as would my family my friends my coworkers would miss me and for sure one of my bosses would be absolutely lost without mewhen i was a teenager i would have really vivid dreams in which i would die in some new horrible fashion every night i am not exaggerating it was worse when i would workout its no different now at 28 my mind has gotten more creative it lures me into dreams where my life is perfect then little by little like picking flaking paint off an old door with your fingernails it starts to fall apart if i have a garden the plants start to die or turn poisonous slowly infecting the ground and working its thorny vines into my perfect house and tearing apart everything inside with an agonizing slowness i can do nothing to stop the vines wrap around me and hold me as my husband opens the door i try to scream to warn him but i amchoking they stab him through the heart and slowly crush me while he slumps against the door frame dying once hes dead the vines release me only to fell me with a similar blow before i can escape i die knowing that the vines will claim anyone who comes near the house to check on things when i wont answer my phone or my husband hasnt shown up at the office or responded to clients in days its my fault i planted the garden in high school i had pets lived with my parents and two sisters and had lots of friends nearbymy family is only an hour away but i dont want to let them know whats going on my husband is out of town and i dont want him to worry i have one friend in my new city and i dont know her all that well and i dont want her to thinki amcrazy i feel like someone is sitting on my stomach with one hand on my chest and the other forcing my face to look at the nightstand while listing off all my flaws fears shortcomings and failures i know what they want i know whats in the top drawer just inches below my hand thats gripping its top i am waiting for my sanity to come save me i am typing this hoping that part of myself that wants to live and knows that there is too much to do to die right now shows up soon the part that still isnt my biggest fan but holds way too much pride to let me fail too bad the side of me that says you really shouldnt do that its so weak selfish and shameful think of your mom think of your dad what would they do would you really put them through sorting through all your shit to find some clue you didnt leave your husband would be so ashamed how could he feel okay about having people over to comfort him with all this mess you should get up and clean something this is ridiculous not to mention youre overweight what would they bury you in none of your nice things fit anymore at least lose some weight and clean the house first we can revisit this theni need a dog not even a therapy dog just a dog feeding myself is not reason enough to get out of bed taking care of myself is not enough for me to go for a walk my need and my husbands need to live in a clean and healthy home is not enough to move from our bed but i do have a friend coming over tomorrow night shell definitely think i was crazy if i didnt call or answer the door when she got here if i had a dog though i would have gotten up hours ago to feed it and let it out i am not enough to live for but i have had a dog before that dog was my life i am living to get to a point in my life where it wouldnt be irresponsible or inconsiderate to get a dog life is too busy and uncertain right now and it wouldnt be fair to the dog but i really need one right now edit i need something external to push me from this place because that gun is really close and i am having trouble talking myself out of this edit2 so woke up totally fine thanks everyone who talked to me last night hopefully i wont be back here anytime soon posting about my suicidal thoughts i plan on coming back to help others going through similar situations

1,nothing makes things better i am 26 years old jobless guy who didnt finish his masters degree ironically i actually completed more credits than required but i got c grades or lower in 4 subject as a result of universities policy i was dismissed without the masters degree because i dont have the degree i cant find a job asi am in a foreign country so i just stopped caring about career working etc and havent worked in like 2 years i skated by borrowing money from friends and while i paid most of it back i still got a lot of debt so i stopped talking to people at all and stopped going outside or pretty much doing anything just get up do stuff on laptop eat go to sleep and nowi amabsolutely hopelessly unable to pay rent or even buy food my mom and dad fight all the time and dad has mentally emotionally even physically abused us for years i dont ask money from them coz well i dont want to and they wont give it mom will but not dad and since dad doesnt give her any money she has to work so i cant ask her i havent told them of the terrible situation i am in i think they do care but mostly because it will make them look bad i dont find enjoyment in any of my old favorite things or any present or future stuff many of my friends have found success in jobs relationships etc but since i am so ashamed of myself i cant even talk to them not even to congratulate them no big tragedy has hit me like for example hurricane harvey wrecked houston people died they lost their house cars pets etc but i was completely unharmed by it walked around aimlessly at peak night time but no thug or junkie has ever attacked me stole my wallet phone etc stuff like that i want to end this hopeless life but i simultaneously think it is both pathetic and beyond my strength to do so dont think i will ever be able to jump in front of a car or train coz well i figure if i get hit and dont die straightaway i will be a crippled loser which i believe is worse than just loser i am so done

1,this is the most i could do firstly if you are thinking of sending help please don t as much as i admire you re noble intentions it s much too late for me i ve tried getting help it s not meant to be as the mental health services as has my doctor have concluded that i m not unwell enough based on my past achievements also i ve not decided to end my life right away but rather i ll do it after i ve tied up a few loose endsi have been doing my research and my conclusion is that for me this will be best for me i m autistic i lost both my parents i was an only child and therefore i no longer have any family i was a full time carer for my mother for 15 years she was disabled and very sick but my efforts to save her failed i completed my duties as her carer and her son but these past two years living for myself brings me no purpose no happiness no hope just loneliness and a newfound drug addiction that brings me some comfort and pleasure in my lost existencedue to my aforementioned autism i have difficulty forming relationships as if being gay wasnt difficult enough people i do meet after talking to them online like the sound of me but don t actually like me in person and so don t give me a chance i m in my early thirties and i ve never been in a relationship that has made me happy including friendships i m also living with the effects of abuse i m no longer being abused however i find myself ruminating about the past and have never truly healed from itrather than suicide i see this as an act of euthanasia the first time i tried to accomplish this task it resulted in me laying unconscious for a few days in my house that i lived alone in it may not be a natural death but to me it feels natural either existence ceases or i ll be reunited with all the loved ones i lost and we can be a family again but one things for sure this is the end of my existence that i fought to exist in to the point of exhaustioni don t know why i m posting this i suppose just so there s a record of my thoughts out there somewherethank you for reading
1,i feel likei amcrazy i feel like i have something seriously wrong with me i cant tell if its just depression and anxiety anymore i dont feel right i dont enjoy anything anymore my head feels cloudy i feel jealous of other people all the time over small trivial things i can never express how i feel when i look at my selfies i look mentally disturbed i think thats iti ama very mentally disturbed person i lack empathy i lack the ability to see things through others eyes i waste all my time away doing nothing i have no goals i feel like i have no confidence in my abilities physically i always feel awkward as if my muscle memory doesnt existi amvery noncaring towards other people my family included idk i need to see a professional i feel so powerless as if nothing in my life matters i often worry about my health wondering why i have heart palpitations all the time and why i feel like i constantly have coldallergy symptoms honestlyi amafraid to go to the doctors becausei amafraid i have cancer or some terminal i willness sometimes i worry its cancer in the brain and thats why i havent felt like myself for so long i have very little control over my thoughts i have very little control over my facial expression i just dont knowi amreligious i believe when we die we go somewhere better with that in mind i just think whats the point in living ifi ameventually just going to die anyways and in all likelihood that death will be horribly painful and gruesome life just feels likei amwaiting for that horrible terrifying moment nothing seems to matter when things do seem to matter they just dont stick i cant stop questioning my worth skill and abilities i feel like i can sympathise with people who commit mass shootings not that i would ever do something so terrible but i feel like i know how those people felt they felt useless and defeated nihilistic and jealous filled with a kind of hatred towards the world and other people not because of something other people did to them but because of the toxic feelings other peoples lives brought about within themselves they stopped caring they snapped i will never snap but i sympathize with how those killers felt the average person writes them off as crazy they werent crazy they were just mentally weakened by their own thoughts and life experiences idk this whole thing is nonsensical it feels like today there is a boulder resting on my body a metaphysical boulder that only i can see and feel 
1,welp this is the end i am such an idiot i am such a colossal idiot i had a perfect job was about to get hrt and see my fiance and i blew it i fucking blew it i took a purse out of a trashcan now the company wants me to pay it back and fired me in the process ontop of my already massive student debt i was also thoroughly humiliated through the processthis is it either tonight or tomorrowi amtaking a gun to my head and pulling the trigger i will never live this down i cant pay it back and itll probably be on my record forever so i guess this really is the end i fucking knew things were going to well i knew things were going to well for me not to fuck it up in some colossal fantastic waygoodbyei amdone this is just where it stops this stupid story has gone on far enoughi amgetting rest
1,here i go again expectations are a bitch i will tell you that just got my grades for the midterm and it fucking sucked this is my third times repeating the first year of collegei ama fuckup no other way to look at itive written down reasons for myself on why killing myself soon is better than trying to slog through lifei wont let people down anymore wont be disappointing elders and friends everyone thinksi amsmart and have what it takes but fuck that ive been stuck in the same level of college for so long all my high school classmates are going to be seniors next year and here i am stuck in first year people will always know me as that guy who got left behind when i was still in high school and middle school i was an honor student but look at me nowi ama fucking good for nothing stupid guy i wont be wasting my parents time and money on me anymore i feel like staying alive is just a waste to their money sorry for all the money theyve spent on me this fari ama good for nothing people have been trying to help me and i dont really appreciate what they do for me i mean i accept what theyre doing for me but what does it even matter fuck maybe killing myself i really the way to go people wont expect anything of me anymore and dont say it gets better thats what people expect been telling me for sometime but no r what i will always be a fuck up and you cant change that i dont know if i can even change myself expectations are a bitch i will tell you that
1,i dont know man my story is pretty pathetic ive dug myself this social hole where i literally have no one and no one will even approach me i had one good friend and she got upset with me because she didnt want to hear about my problems anymore and so i stopped bringing them up but i was struggling so much i couldnt talk to anyone and she gave up on me and hates me now i had a girlfriend and she honestly made the world light up for me and then she broke up with me and now ive got nothing left ive been on a downward spiral for over a year and i just feel so alone i have nothing going for mei amconsidered gifted but my motivation has run so dry that i can barely pass a class and i amuseless at basically any life skillsi am going no where in life and it hurts because i just need someone to be there for me i cry myself to sleep every night and no one could give less of a shit about me the only reason i havent killed myself yet is because i cant figure out a way to make it quick and painless i just want the hurting to end i dont want to cause morei dont even know what i hope to achieve by posting this i just want to shout my problems into the void so maybe someone will hear me
1,i have tried everything and plan to give up tonight is there anything i could do that i havent ive tried ketamine treatments antidepressants even went to therapy this past week yet here i am crying hanging a noose in my closet i really tried to survive is there a treatment that ive missed and would have benefitted from 
1,flashback i just looked at the knife block in my kitchen and i remembered a time when i was 11 or 12 or maybe younger but i grabbed a knife and i was holding it on myself because i wanted to die and that was when i was a kid and now i m hardly an adult and it s all making me cry
1,i am going to try to express myself honestly because i dont know where to turn right now please forgive the lengthsome context i am 19 i am a man and i am in college i have been struggling with depression social anxiety and suicidal thoughts for 3 and 34 years i have been hospitalized 3 times and been involved with some form of therapy for a large part of that time period i attempted suicide once and almost attempted quite a few times thereafter i went to college at 18 and these same feelings resulted in me losing my scholarship and being forced to transfer closer to home damni amprivileged as shiti feel likei am going insane because of how quickly i fly from a really good mood to planning my suicide these past few days have been rough with this chemistry lab that i keep missingi amalmost certain that i dont have bipolar but the thought of untreated diagnoses or of mistreated diagnoses scares the shit out of mei amalso afraid of getting involved with medicine becausei amafraid of what my parents would think since they seem to think thati am doing better even thoughi am still having similar problems as the last college i also dont want to mess with meds while my attendance at my current college is so tenuous i am on academic probation you see i wouldnt want to jeapordize the future while trying to get betteri am really lonely and meeting new people make me extremely uncomfortable i am so afraid that they would reject or ridicule me for experiencing depression and anxiety as incessantly as i do even though i recieved positive responses from everyone ive shared this with except my parents the social anxiety gets to the point where i wont leave my room unless i know my roommates arent there because i dont want them to see me and my sordid condition the fact that i am anxious makes me so upset that i think about killing myself because i dont see myself ever getting past it even though i have made considerable progress since a year ago it still feels likei am going nowhere and i know thats emotional reasoning but it still hurts so much when it feels like ive made no progressi get furious and hopelessly sad to the point of tears when i see people who are doing better than me like my roommate said i shouldnt compare my chapter 1 to what could be someone elses chapter 20 but i feel so angry at myself and everyone else when i see people who seem socially capable when i cant even look strangers in the eye on the way to class i also feel so upset when i hear people tell me that it will get better because they really dont know it could always get a lot worse and then i could finally kill myself they sound so goddamn presumptuous as if they dont know how condescending that sounds it makes me feel so broken and stupidcan i talk about how hopeless i feel i am really concerned as you might imagine i dont have a significant other i feel hopeless about ever forming that type of relationship with someone because my depression social anxiety and suicidal thoughts are things that will never go away for me and i ampretty sure that no one would want to start a relationship with someone like that so it follows that i have thoughts that i will never be able to form that kind of relationship while being honest about how i feel to that other person i feel likei ama quivering baby that no one could feel anything for but pity i feel likei ama broken egg trying to hold myself together and i ampretty sure that i have to be more secure in myself before those kinds of relationships of course the perpetual nature of my bad mental stuff leads me to believe that i will never be secure in myself and that i can never get a significant otheri knowi amyoung but ive made a lot of mustakes that make me wish i had jumped off of rhe manhattan bridge when i had the chancei am really afraid to talk to my two close friends about this because i want to respect that they have problems too i also get distorted thinking that leads me to believe that no one really cares and no one wants to hear my problems i mean in a way it is true insofar as no one wants to hear the bad news of heyi amfaring very poorly but i also understand thay theyd rather recieve that bad news than the worse news of hey your friendacquaintance temporalindifference has been found dead by suicideits just so damn hard for me to think clearly when i feel as bad about myself as i doand of course as with a lot of my type the only time i can escape any of these feelings is eheni amplaying video games masturbating listening to music or painting my wh40k figurines ei things that i can do alone and as we all know none of these are good reasons to live in themselves so i get this creeping sense of delaying my inevitable suicidei remember seeing this question on this therapy intake form that said something like how likely do you think you are to die of suicide it was a question i have never heard before and maybe i misread it i feel like my suicide is as inevitable as my depression is chronic
1,its just too much to bear anymorei am too weak for this i was not cut out for living in this existence i was never meant to be here i dont belong here i am too weak there is no place for me here my emotions are too strong for me to bear i cannot go on living like this the pain is too much i am nothing fuck everything make it end please

1,am trying to die ive written on another thread about my recent break up and i just simply cannot get past it what even is the point anymore all i can think about these days are different ways to die i get in a taxi or a bus or a train i chant to myself kill me kill me kill me i intentionally walk slowly when i cross the road i stare down buildings looking for the best way and the quickest way to end my life the only thing stopping me right now is knowing how devastated my family will be when i do it but honestly all i want to do right now is end the misery that is going on in my head today i found out my ex is on tinder barely a week after the break up we were supposed to get married we were engaged we were living together but everything is just gone just like that wow he truly cant wait to replace me am i that bad 
1,am so scared to kill myself but i see no other wayi ama 17 yo boy i always help anyone i always give everything what i have i never asked for help or anythingi am trying my best but i am still fucking useless i want to die so hard since years i have nothing to live for i hate everything and everybody nothing seriously nothing and nobody interests me i cant get excited about girls anymore human body is disgusting i just cant think about sex more it makes me sick i hate talking because everybody so fucking selfish i just stopped talking with people some years ago they ask but i know they dont really care about whati amsaying thats why my environment thinks thati ama totally okay quiet kid and they will be surprised when i kill myself i feel thati amthe worst i dont think i deserve to have relationships with other people i deserve to die slowly and painfully i hope i get cancer or something like that rarely whenever i think someone is nice and may shehe can be my friend or wtf i always think about how many other friendsgirlfriendsrelativesfamily members shehe can have and i amgetting feel myself useless because why that human want to me if they can have other friends who are definitely better than me thats why ive got nobody who loves me except my mom but i hate her because she loves me i didnt ask her to take care of me shes just making my life harder i can be dead now years ago if she didnt make me feel remorse about iti amwaiting for my mothers death so then finally i can kill myself easily i never asked for attention and i still dont want it i hate it but at least one time in my life i want to do something selfish suicide and i just cant fucking do thati am so scared about it i make plans about it every nighti ambegging for a surprise accident or whatever what can kill me just kill meactually i dont need help i dont want to get better i dont need answers i just have to tell someone what i feel so thank you i know i will kill myself by a train i just dont know when maybe today or tomorrow but i said it 2 months ago too so maybe i can survive 2017 but when i finally have one more reason for it i will do it
1,i don t really feel anything i just want to die i can t do anything i need to do and i think it s more practical to give my body back to the earth than to live on hurting it more and fighting off the inevitability of death i crack smiles and i participate in meaningless conversations with my parents and people at school but it s not me it s just the shell of the human i m keeping alive when the actual person inside me wants to die i cried when i first considered seriously killing myself again but i cried for maybe 30 seconds and then i went numb and now i m here i ve already attempted to take my life once in the year following i has motivation to live i had emotions that made me feel warm and strong and now it s all gone and i just feel like a void i m losing weight because i have no desire to eat and no motivation to get help from family or friends or medical professionals i don t even know how i d bother to kill myself because i m in such an apathetic state
1,i just tried to kill myself i tied the belt around my neck and the top of my dresser i wanted to know if i could go through with iti am too tall to fully hang so i relaxed my body and closed my eyes within a couple of seconds my arms and legs were tingling and i started to fade out my brains natural reaction was to stand up and save myself after some googling i found out that if i had waited just a couple more seconds to go unconscious i wouldve died within 20 minutes no one would know i live alone in an off campus university apartment my girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me and said she just didnt want to be in a relationship right now and that down the road we could try again i know shes lyingi amoverwhelmed with university things and i can barely take care of myself at my apartment i wish i wouldve gone through with killing myself its the only solution i have to all my problems 
1,greedy cynical pathetic moody selfish asshole i am matt i am 19 years old it all stems from incest done to be my brother growing up but at this point it can t be changed my views are part of me theirs nothing for me nothing to be done or changed i have tried therapy group sessions religion but the only thing that numbs the pain is drugs and alcohol from the age of 12 i remember thinking i don t know when or how but i am going die from self inflicted suicide and it s the truth that s also around the time my substance abuse issues started i don t know why i can t let myself be happy i hate myself to the very roots i hate people and i can t stand their company i can t stand even looking anyone in the eye i can t enjoy simple things like sex or conversation or a beautiful fall day anymoreat the end of the day we our all just self righteous apes we fuck we eat we sleep and we look out for ourselves like i said i have a substance abuse problem this started from an early age marijuana was my drug of choice and i thought i was happy hell maybe i still would be if i could enjoy it but it changed on me so now i drink heavily and will use pretty much any downer i can get my hands on what bothers me the most is am with the most amazing girl i love her but yet i resent her i resent her for expecting more of me i reset her for not letting me sit in my room and play video games all day the funny thing is in my fucked up world i don t think she s good enough for me me the socially inept angry bitter retard she deserves so much better and i wish i could give her more i rely on my mom and grandparents for everything and in return i am a moody irritable asshole i have know aspirations know hope for the future the only things i really care about are my dog and cat and yet i have failed them both because they both have gum disease that i will rely on said family members to fix i often fantasize about being gunned down suffocating myself hanging myself or blowing my head off it calms me and gives me solace i hate who i am i hate the world i inhabit i hate that i treat all the amazing people around me like burdens on my back i am not meant to be here man that is all i know sorry to ramble 
1,i 16f need someone to talk to i don t feel comfortable posting the details but i think i m ready to talk to someone about it please pm me or comment if you re versed at all in the effects of rape incest sexual abuse etc don t message me if you re looking to get off on a kid being taken advantage of find your porn somewhere else i m really struggling and i can t do this alone anymore i can t stop fantasizing about ending it all right now but i know it would be a mistake
1,my last attachment is gone so why shouldnt i my best friend has stopped giving a shit about me what i thought was the closest friendship ive ever had one that would actually last for once has crumbled for no reason other thani ama sad worthless useless piece of shit its a miracle she ever cared completely i willogicalmy best friends always leave i should be used to it by now but how tf you supposed to get used to betrayal i thought this time was different i never felt so close i was actually coming out if my shell and she dropped me like the worthless sack of flesh i am and i amsupposed to what just try again like a shitty fucking video game oops game over try again next time i dont think i can anymore so someone please why tf shouldnt i she wont care noone cares i could delete myself out like a useless redunant leftover line of code and noone would miss me everything would keep running and whats the point of living the same painful 6 months over and over again hope caring and betrayal hope caring and betrayal why should anyone live through that
1,its all downhill from here long i went to one of the best high schools in my state i got okay grades made some friends and generally just tried to get through school unnoticed i was depressed for most of high school but i never had any suicidal ideations just selfharm i went to a local college where i was going to study engineering it wasnt my first choice since stem subjects arent my specialty but it was what my parents suggested so i went with it i did poorly in my first semester and had a few suicide attempts i stood on a balcony of a tenstory building several times but never got the nerve to jump when i came home for christmas my parents were mad at me for hiding my poor grades from them and i became even more depressed i stayed in bed most days during the spring semester and ended up trying to overdose in april i panicked and called 911 ending up in a psychiatric hospital it was a shitty place and i hope to never go there again my parents found out about my suicide attempt and i told them about my depression so they decided to send me to a therapistpsychiatrist they werent very helpful but i got some meds that at least helped me get out of bed i went back to school in the fall for accounting which my counselor recommended i try after taking an aptitude test school went just as poorly as it had previously though and it was a repeat of last years christmas break i went back to school in the spring but did poorly again this summer i got a customer service job and dropped out of college ever since ive been lying to my friends and convincing themi am still at college even though they never see me on campusif you bothered to read that whole story youve probably noticed a pattern in my life of things getting worse i was always told i could do great things but here i am at 20 going to work at a grocery store at 5 am i dont see my life getting better from here so i only see two possible futures one is where i live out the rest of my life working crappy jobs and leeching off of other people i disappoint everyone around me for decades until eventually i die miserable and alone alternately i kill myself now those closest to me will probably suffer a bit mourn for a little while but eventually theyll move on their lives will continue without me as a burden on them i will be free from worrying about the future and having to deal with my mistakes one of these futures is much more enticing than the other and i amrunning out of reasons not to choose the latter just looking for some outside opinions on what i should dotldr my life is awful and its easier to die now than live in suffering for decades so why not just end it

1,18002738255 i have this number memorized by heart as if it were a part of me i dial it and sit there thinking phone in one hand and knife in the other my girlfriend whos still with me said out of the blue last night while were talking and joking that were two different people and she cant picture us being together i then told her to think about the fact that she loved me and she asked but do i i told her shes the only one i want and i wont give up and she proceeds to ask but are you the one i want half an hour later she says she loves me then 15 mins after that she said dont try to change just because she doesnt picture us togetheri amsitting here with my best friends knife and hotline youd love them they kill me i dont know if this is my last words and my goodbye to this world but i might as well leave some form of record if it is
1,i read something here the other night and i amafraid it inspired me first time posting 20somethingfi amthe first person to sayi am not suicidal but man am i depressed and feel better off dead i read a post i found in the depths somewhere the other night it was from a train operator requesting people not kill themselves by means of the railroad because of the trauma it inflicts on the operator while i understand that this post finally gave me what i was a looking for how i can surely end my lifei have been struggling for normality and comfort in my life for quite sometime after my life suddenly crumbled to a pile of constant spontaneous combustioni am not really sure where to begin there if someone asks i will share but i could honestly write a book as the world turns in my universe and people would think i was a good writer ive been seeing a psychologist for almost 3 years now she is very helpful but she cant change my chemical imbalance and she certainly cant fix the shithole that is my life i am scared now though because it is sinking in more and more that this is who i am for life i currently live with a railroad in my backyard i literally mean it would take all of 30 seconds to be on the tracks and dead once i heard or saw a train the fantasy of this is so fucking freeing but dont even get started on the nightmare of its reality tldr i am pretty confident i wont lay down on the railroad tracks or kill myself at all but i have fallen in love with the idea of doing so 
1,i just want to die i cant take this life i just cant every problem in my entire life all leads back to because i had to be born male why why did i have to have my life ruined like this i will never get to transition and even if i could i would never pass and no male would ever want to date me no one would want to be my friend because id be referred to as some freak or faggot because the world is a fucked place i cant do anything at all about it its all so hopeless all i can do is stay in bed all day and stay high so the suicidal thoughts arent as bad i can just feel sorry for myself and thats it no one cares about me and thats because i had to be born male i could make people like me i wouldnt be so boring if i couldve just been born in the correct gender i just want to die theres no hope and i am tired of suffering please just make it end please

1,am really concerned about my boyfriend weve both midteens been dating for around a year and hes been struggling with mental i willness and social issues and isolation almost his entire life hes talked to me about his past traumas and suicide attempts and ive tried to make sure he feels heard and understood sometimes hed get really drunk and high and tell me about when hes planning to kill himself it had been in spring then summer hes told me hes only stuck around so he wouldnt fuck me up but very recently hes relapsed with self harm and been very quiet and withdrawni am really worried about him hes so much more valuable than he knows hes been diagnosed with several mental i willnesses including depression generalized anxiety adhd and some type of schizophrenia recently his hallucinations have been getting worse he is not receiving proper treatment every time he and his parent go to a therapist they put him on the same medication that does nothing to help him because hes at risk for addiction so they give him the least a usable medication so he stops taking it after a few months and goes back to self medication with recreational drugs and alcohol i really do believe hes trying to do the best he can a lot of the time and recreational drugs are the closest he can get to what he needs after most of our mutual friends moved away hes been really alone and i amworried thats worsening things for him i try to tell him how much i love him and how even though he might not see it that hes smart and loving and valuablei am trying to be there for him but i amworriedi am not doing enough or being smothering what can i do to help him id do anything to make him feel better thank you

1,its just so funny i can post on and get no responses no upvotes at all but plenty of views i post here sayingi amgonna end it all and all of a sudden theres an outpouring of support and people telling me to contact them if i need to saying i need to reach out and get help etc etc etc and its the same shit offline too you tell someone youre depressed and sad and its like yeah okay but when are you but as soon as you say you wanna kill yourself people suddenly care its all for selfish reasons too no one wants to be the one who ignored a suicidal person but its fine to brush off someone before they get to that point like yall do realize that feeling alone and helpless is what pushes people to that point right
1,not yet some day maybe first time posting life has hit a dead end and honestlyi amdisappointed with myself and everything i feel like everything and everyone that once made me happy are fading soon i will be an unfeeling husk i dont want that id rather die than exist without any feeling or meaningi amjustteetering on the edge

1,nothing will ever be ok its too late for me to make any lasting changes or recover in school for my dream job and everything one after the other has gone wrong its too late to fix anything was it worth taking a shot absolutely is it worth it to continue 
1,first time having suicidal thoughts my depression started when i realized what was happening with me during my childhoodhighschool period my parents were always treating me as if i m not capable of doing things or useless thinking they are doing good thing to me they would presume that i was going to fail or trying to do the work for me to this day they still treat me like i m useless piece of shit and because of that i had never really tried anything to do to prove them wrong because i dont want to prove anyone wrong about something like that recently i ve passed my last exam on my uni i was doing a project in a programing language an online shop my mother was angry on my brother because he didnt do the project for me when she heard i passed she couldnt believe it i have no motivation to be good at anything ive been brought down so many times i feel likei amalone in this and its really hard when your closest cant give you support you need they dont trust me and my skills they keep reminding me of my homework or anything that i have to do because they think i m unable to do it by myself to be responsible for something the moment i passed my last exam i felt huge depression because i expected atleast from my closest a littlebit of faith in me i proved them wrong and that i m capable of doing something right but i dont care about that as i already said i want to prove to myself and i find my parents attitude extremely distracting and demotivatingi am too scared of failing anymore i feel like i wouldnt take it good if i failed i have no selfesteem no faith in myself this wouldnt bother me so much if i wasnt actually capable of doing well payed things like programing suicide came across my mind because i m scared of ending up with minimal wage job with all the wasted potential i think i would kill myself if i end up like that i ve spent my whole life thinking that everyone else was better than me 
1,amjust so tired ive been suicidal for a little over a decade everyday i think about killing myself without fail obviously on good daysweeks i hear that thought in my head and just shrug it off but the bad daysjust keep piling on and keep getting worse and worseim just tired tired of everything tired of continuing life because its selfish of me to end it how is it selfish of me to want this pain ive been feeling for the majority of my life to stop but not selfish of to condemn me for feeling this way because dont want me to diei cant handle this right now any of this and i just feel like everything is closing in on me this strange feeling that my life is coming to a close soon i try to try and let it all out but no matter what i can only muster up a few tears after years of suppressing emotions and tears and sadness i think i broke myself and i think the end is in sightall i ever wanted was to feel happy 
1,my only reason to live is to not hurt others with my own death i don t really know where else to turn about this i ve been suicidal for years now and i m tired of people telling me that it s going to get better when the sad thing is that things haven t and things don t appear able to improve in the future honestly in most of my life situations it just seems like god is a cruel little kid who builds me up for excitement only to follow it up with extreme disappointment and sadness sometimes within the hour it s starting to feel really fucked up i just want a win for once in my life it dawned on me last night that the only reason for me to not go ahead and just end my life is the effect it would have on my family which means my only purpose is to just exist in pain and not cause any to others i don t want to hurt my mom with my death but i really don t think i can do this for much longer i know this all sounds so selfish but i m just looking for a reason to live has anyone else felt this way before how did you overcome it what have you found to give you purpose and not fall into the void
1,meet them where they are here is one of the few safe places that people can come and talk openly about suicide without judgement and in theory without eliciting an immediate emotional response that blocks that person from expressing their feelingsthe responses here are obviously going to be different to the responses that would be received by or made by the people that come here in real life in a non professional face to face settingi would be the first to admit that if i suffered a tragedy tomorrow i wouldnt be in the best place to be here and be presentand thats exactly the point its the realisation that its not that simple as thinking count yourself lucky because oh my you dont think that people destroy themselves that they cant think like that that they dont scream at themselves to stop feeling the way that they dohere it is safe and we meet them where they are we join them in their despair even with the knowledge that we may not be able to make anything better but offering that space and time may be the one thing that is needed and that nobody else has ever done for themit is in fact a very precious thing to be able to offer yourself to just be with somebody else and fully present to themamy
1,i wanna just kill myselfi am so tired of life the only thing that keeps me going are small things like video games food and enjoying laying in bed i dont want that to end and thats it everything else doesnt mean shit because i dont have anyone maybe a few friends but they dont understand depression or anything and they dont help at all i guess they would care if i killed myself but so many people say that and i feel like its only because they feel bad and want to cheer me up or something but it doesnt i have tried to kill myself before but i made sure i was only hospitalized because it was a cry for help so people would take me seriously yet people still dont but when i do kill myself people will all miss me and act like they cared and tried to help right i hate school too ive failed 9th grade twice and i amfucking stupid and i cant take it teachers treat me like garbage because they know ive failed twice and overall lowers my already non existant self esteem i hate how i look and how my body is its never as good as any other guys i dont have abs or anything special at all girls barely even acknowledge i exist and girls who i have dated either cheated on me or left leaving me to think they just felt bad for me my family treats me like a disappointment too i dont wanna drop out but i feel like i have to or else i will be in high school forever sorry if this isnt that organized just needed to rant or something because i cant handle this for much longer 
1,please tell me what is wrong with me i know i already have a lot of obvious problems like my appearance my weight my race my sexuality my intelligence and my lack of talent or skill but is there something deeper wrong with me when i tell my mom i love her she always likes to say you dont love me you just love what i do for youshes been saying that for a long time and shes right of coursei am21 with no job no high school education and i sit on my ass all day doing nothing while she works but i dont know if i actually dont love her i dont know if i love anyonei became more curious about this today when i was talking with a friend and he said he doesnt think i will ever be happy and that i dont care about anything he knows me pretty well so hes probably right also but i dont want to end up like that i dont think i have a choice thougheven though i knowi am so fucked up and worthless and everythingi amnever going to do anything about it i dont even shower or brush my teeth or anything i dont clean or cook maybe i just dont give a shit about anything maybei amincapable of truly loving anyone maybe i should just dieits stupid of me the post this and none of you will have a magic solution i doubt anyone will even read all of this and reply but i guess it makes me feel a bit better to do it
1,can someone just talk to me i just want to connect and then i will be ok
1,suicide may be a permanent solution but 1 it is a solution and 2i am not looking for temporary solutions i resent that saying so much permanent solution to a temporary problem ugh
1,a window into my life i guess this was an email i sent to someone last night typos probably depression anxiety being alone not truly being needed by anyone here it sucks it hurts no one needs me herei amjust here for the sole purpose of existing no one would care or notice if i disappeared tonight no one bothers to ask me howi am doing today no one stops to ask me ifi am doing okay everyone has a group of friends who love them endlessly and actually want to see them outside of school and talk to them and everythingi amjust a background decoration in everyones lives and all i need is to just be validated all i ever wanted was to feel wanted this life is literal hell its my personal hell id rather be anywhere but here id rather be anyone else but me i dont want this body i dont want this life maybe if i go people will notice no one fucking talks to me unless they need me to listen to their problems and god i want to help but it sucks thati amjust a personal therapist to everyone just once id like someone to text me like hey how are you feeling today or a message like you matter to me and i need you here no one fucking cares people say they do but no one fucking listens to me when i text them asking for help my insides are crying save me now fuck this life fuck this world i dont want to be me i feel so fucking alonei am so sick of waking up every single day and wishing i didnt i am sick of crying so much i cant fucking stand being such an outcast all i ever fucking wanted was to fit in i hate myself more than words could ever fucking describe and i just want to blow my face to goddamn bits with a shotgun i feel so goddamn bad that you have to read this shit because its not easy to hear these kind of words i hate that i care about everyone so goddamn much i wish i could stop when everyone else wakes up their nightmares end mine never does everyday i pray that i will wake up from this dream and be a happy beautiful child who is loved by everyone this mental i willness is tearing me up right in front of everyones eyes and no one cares i talk about killing myself a lot and i bet if i were to be in the middle of killing myself no one would stop me ive been depressed since i was a child wanna know what fucking sucks about teen depression while everyone is living the best years of their life by going to parties making awesome memories falling in love and so oni am noti amwishing my own fucking life awayi amscared that i will just be thrown into a hospital again and be put on meds that just make me feel so damn numb i am so ready to go i dont want to be here anymore everyday is a battle with myself its like going to war with the enemy and each battle ends in your bitter defeat but you still show up on the battle field every day even though you know youre going to get your ass kicked each day the wounds become deeper and more severe you grow weaker and weaker and then one day you wave a white flag and its over or the enemy finally kills you either way you will lose to your demons i have accepted the fact that my demons will win and fuck maybe they already havei am tired of fighting 
1,i dont really understand hi i just felt like posting my thoughts somewhere sincei amfeeling a bit down and a tad bit introspective ive decided to share a bit of my life with the internet which i know isnt exactly the smartest thing but heyi amhere might as wellokay so ive been suicidal and depressed on and off for a couple of years now i cant exactly tell you when it started since problems like this usually stem from childhood issues but i can say that it certainly started getting worse sometime around grade seven or eight now ive been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder ocd and severe depression but i am not currently seeing any therapist due to my parents disbelief in mental i willness i think that they might not want to believe that their daughter has any type of problem at all or maybe this all ties into their general ignorance of things i dont hate my parents but i dont really believe in their values theyre racist homophobic my dad is sexist and my mother uses religion to justify everything she does okay back to me like i said i have a couple of mental issues with my depression and ocd probably being the worst of the bunch my ocd is very very disruptive of daily lifei am not particularly religious but i am not an atheist i am a 16 soon to be 17 year old girl and my sexuality is homosexual though i dont like the term lesbian very much due to its oversexualized connotation i like pretty boring stuff like writing reading and drawingi amparticularly interested in writing and i would like to become an author and hopefully slow down the death process of modern literature yeahi ama stud arent i i have relationship issues with my girlfriend but i wont get into that hereright now in a general reference to daily life i feel nothing nothing i can particularly say my emotions are somewhat normal if a bit exaggerated in the moment but on an overarching scale i feel fairly empty even so ive been thinking about killing myself i used to think that i gave up cutting after having a little dispute with my mother over the scabbylines on my wrist its been about two years since then and ive started cutting up my thighs on an almost daily basisi am not like one of those edgy teens where i cut because of the physical pain distracts from the emotional pain i think its simply because of the dopamine reward my brain gives me for doing something good ive just always had a slightly high pain tolerance and i find myself attracted to the pair of sharpened scissors hiding away in my desk drawer last night though i had used a different pair they were the closest thing to me at the time and i ended up cutting myself a nice little and by little i mean huge gash right across my thigh i almost thought i needed stitches for a second i remember the initial spark of pain and then there was nothing it wasnt the numbness of a severed nerve no it just didnt i pressed down on it to stop the bleeding no pain i could feel myself pressing down but it just wasnt accompanied by any pain it was an almost surreal experience for me thats got me thinking i havent killed myself out of fear for the pain since i live in canada with no guns and i have no access to tall buildings and i dont own a car or have access to any potentially lethal pills the only viable method of killing myself that i have are the knives in my kitchen i had held one against the throat in the past but never had the guts to bring it down i have imagined stabbing myself in the stomach on multiple occasions but could never actually pull a knife that leads me to wonder about slitting my wrists ive heard of how painful it is but right now i cant really find myself caring i dont particularly care about anything at all school is easy i have nineties in every class and i havent studied a single day in my life i dont ever have any homework to worry about because i finish it all in class with time to spare i have enough friends to satisfy me and a girlfriend to keep me occupied romantically though i cant really comprehend sexual or romantic attraction so its more or less another form companionship to me and other than my earlier sediments on my parents i dont have a particularly bad home life my career as an author and english teacher is but a givenin fact for other people i might have an amazing life i just cant what phrase would be correct here comprehend yeah i guess i just cant the meaning of life sure i can understand the complex inner workings of society and the average human psyche my marks in social studies and psychology prove just that i just find myself unable to understand simple things why is that person happy why is society working away like sheep why am i who i amam i even who i amwho am ii amright then why does it sound so foreign to me why does my body feel like its not actually there i will look at objects pets or people in my life and wonder how they have been there my entire life they look so new and foreign to me i cant understand them in the slightest if i cant understand living then how am i supposed to live am i a sociopath or am i a normal human being simply going through a phase of introspection while my brain is developing into that of an adults could this be some kind of side effect of constantly reading and writing or is there something very very wrong with mei cant understand life so i want to die i cant understand death either so does that mean i have nowhere to turn to then it comes down to the original question should i kill myselfi amim kinda leaning towards a yes here i dont really know how to end something like this honestly i would be surprised if anyone even made it this far thank you for reading my little tale and let me tell you that each and every word here is true these words come from the very bottom of my souli really dont understand anything do i 
1,if you dont know that it might get better why do you insist on staying i saw this too many times everyone is saying to stay but even you dont have hope that it will get better theres even a policy on this subreddit not to do that wishful thinkingso why prolong the inevitable
1,even when things are going relatively well i would rather just not livei am20 years old and a couple courses away from a community college diploma in accounting which can be transferred to give me half of the credits for a bachelorsi was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when i was about 13 but i never went on medicationi have had good times and bad times over the past few years it seems that recently the bad times have been getting more frequentsome courses in school give me no problem at all i aced things like financial accounting but if i have to write anything i will probably failfrom the time i was 9 i remember struggling to write stories in class now days tell me to write a memo essay or even something short and i just cant do it i have tried dictating it but that doesnt help i feel i just dont have the ideas in my head to put on paper even when i had to write physics lab reports i found it impossibledue to this i dont think i will ever be able to finish university and i cant handle working somewhere like a grocery store for my whole lifei amfrom canada but this yeari amspending a year abroad in belgium as an au pair i met my girlfriend in a community jazz band while she was taking a gap year in canada and i followed her back to belgium about a month ago she is so amazing and probably the one thing keeping me from falling into a deep depression and seriously considering suicide right nowi have one day a week totally free and i basically slept the whole day i should be exploring belgium 0 or at least go for a walk down the street i talked to my girlfriend and she has been supportive and is trying to help me get out of the house but i find it impossible some days are okay yesterday i went to audition for a choir and it went fairly well she is a very motivated person and i amscared that me doing nothing could pull us aparti also start things with a great deal of motivation but it typically fades quickly and i want to quit this happens with things like school sports work and any other type of activity really it happens even if it is something i really like i just find it hard to drag myself to iti need to figure out how to finish school i need to figure out how to stay motivated be able to tolerate my job and stop being such a negative person all the timeright nowi am really freaked out because i dont know how i can get through all of this i dont know what i will do with my life i have this year to figure things out then i have to go back to canada we did a few months already but a long distance relationship will be its own challenge and face reality i can stay with my mom as long as i am going to school i am thinking maybe i should push through the 3 courses and get my diploma as a checkpoint i was just going to go to university and go straight for my bachelors as i still get the transfer credits but i dont have a clue what i should do after that i think i should probably talk to a professional again i most likely shouldnt wait untili amback in canada but doing it here in belgium is intimidatingthanks

1,i try so hard but even i know thats a lie i dont know whats wrong with me anymore i pissed away so many good things in my life because of what i feel was one persons fault and ive been dragging that ball and chain behind me for years nowi cant find the motivation to change who i am or the situation ive put myself into been homeless lived in the bed of my truck kicked out of countless houses becausei ama terrible employee and cant keep a job i quit my tractor trailer driving job because i didnt want to be away from my family but now thati amhome i cant muster the strength to look them in the face anymorei was always late on rent because i just cant control my money and nowi amsquatting in a run down house with holes in the roof walls and ceiling no plumbing and the only electricity is a drop cord from the neighbors house its just been me and my cats for years going from town to town job to job house to house i feel likei amat the point where ive become such a burden on everyone around me that i cant ask for help because it seems likei amalways leeching off everyone i sleep until i absolutely have to wake up for work because i dont even want to be awake anymore but i amwriting this now because i had a thought to myself that if i were to just off myself now no one would notice for weeks maybe months despite everyone knows where i am because no one cares to visit to call or just acknowledge my existence and i dont blame them
1,since july 29th this year ive been thinking about suicide and that i will do it this year still havent gone to it but will probably do it before christmas i didnt know when it started but about 45 years ago i started to hate myself a lot my first suicide attempt was when my parents fought i just grabbed a knife to stop them from fighting saying that i will kill myself yesi amhorrible but i actually wanted to kill myself that time they asked me whats wrong i answered that i didnt know but i actually know that i hate myself after that my mom kept telling her friends about that as if i cant hear it i never attempted suicide after that but i can still feel the depression and selfhate slipping in then this year happened i almost left home but my parents stopped me and i told them what i actually feel inside i told them that i hate myself and i just kept scratching on my arms i told them i have mental health issues then a week later i accidentally pushed my cousin was pissed off and my parents scolded me i whispered something about my mental health issue and how it couldve affected my thinking but my parents didnt believe me i had a fucking mental breakdown in front of them and yet they think thati am still joking now my mom said something about us being a perfect family since theyre not like those other parents out there who doesnt care about their children and she told me that theyre not the problem i am like for the past 5 years ive known that i am the problem i have a problem i actually thought that they would at least help me but they shrugged me offi ama covert narcissist and i hate that i wanted to change but i cant i cant i cant do this alone thats why i told my parents everything ive felt but i actually dont trust them anymore i dont want to talk to them about my feelings i dont need them to understand i just need them to listen but i could already see that they wont i can see iti amplanning on leaving suicide notes on this laptop and various other placesi amalso hinting on facebook about it i just wanted my parents to save me but i guess they cant i will just save myself from this misery
1,i cut myself again for the sixth time in four weeks ive been sobbing into my pillow for the last ten minutes because of it and everything else in my life i wish the people in my life actually understood what depression is actually like among other things i just want out why did you start cutting yourself make sure you keep it clean getting an infection would suck many people cant really handle the concept of suicide i think society is messed up but this subreddit can help at least a bit 
1,whats the easiest way to commit suicide painless and simple
1,thinking about giving up so i really screwed myself i am going to completely fail a class i cant drop i have tried moving heaven and earth to get out of this class but nothing can be done i feel like ive ruined my futurei amsupposed to be transferring soon but i think thats all over ive essentially lived for my gpa it was one of the only things keeping me going but nowi am so lost i want to end it all even though i know its stupid and selfish i cant talk to anyone about this and its eating me alive i dont know how long i can keep going anymore i just want to sleep forever
1,didnt hang myself because i got spooked out i just think its best for me to go why is even suicide this hard ive just got home from going out to kill myself i had scouted my area for places to hang myself for weeks now and thought i found an adequate spot now so i went there past 2am with my rope to end this misery but upon arriving ive noticed that the path leading to the place i was heading to was not lit by street lamps already gave me a bad vibe but okay time to turn on the torchlight on my phone after a few metres in i got spooked really bad by a tree i mistook for some slendermanesque man and after catching my breath by some animal in the bushes that was to much for me so i went back home everything seemed so unreal like a real life psychedelic horror movie until i got back homei ama bit dissappointed with myself as killing myself would be the best way out of my misery but its not really easy if the sorrow and neuroticism that consumes you transfers into your suicide plans and makes you fear failure to off yourself on the first tryi am not even depressed or feeling sad right nowi am in a pretty neutral state of mind but thinking about myself suicide seems like the logical thing to do i will now read into death by exsanguination as for my bathroom is lit even at night

1,amsick of feeling like my feelings arent real unless theyre experienced in a certain way so maybe killing myself will convince me that i really am sufferingeven ifi am not really suicidal dont know i just wish i was someone else and i know no one will give a shit about that theyll just say be yourself and leave it at that because obviously your persona that annoys people isnt going to cause problems because people will accept you for who you are for some reasonthis life is pointless after all i dont do anything i have no motivation no confidence nothing i dont know why i manage to go onmaybe it doesnt matter if whati amexperiencing is real or not but then id have no reason to do this or maybe it doesnt matter to have a reason jesus i can never keep things consistent in my mind maybe this would be a good thing even if it would hurt everyonewhats the point in trying if i lack to strength to do whatever i want without worrying about being judged or failingi wish i was a guy and i cant even convince myselfi amtransgender because i dont experience it like most of them do i dont have fucking gender dysphoriai amdeluding myself yet id bother killing myself over itwhy am i so dramatici am not cringing irl i just feelempty is that the right wordbut if i did feel a bit more id be cringingmehi still have some life in me i could bother saving myself but i dont feel like it now is the perfect opportunity to justdo somethingabout iti act like an annoying main character in a book i use i too much i feel different from everyone else and focus on it so much that i fail to see how my feelings are legitimate and i whine too much about it i just want people to feel bad for me i want to show themi amsuffering that my life sucks thati am really this great special person that everyone should love because i have no bad intentions yet i troll my own friends when i feel jealousthe wanting sympathy part honestly its probably another reason for the impostor syndrome shitbecause i am faking it somewhatmaybe feeling likei amfaking it is fake too likei am doing that for attention i knowi amposting on reddit for attention i knowi amkilling myself for attention everything is just a cry for help i annoy friends i hardly talk to them about this sort of shit anymore because i feel likei amsuch a burden for them so i go to reddit and i literally post shitty things to strangers and expect sympathy obviously i dont always get it ive used multiple accounts ive acted far too dramatic ive basically been a stupid little bitch bitch doesnt even feel like a good word for mei ampractically the opposite of a slut i purposely make myself look ugly to rebel against the shitty way society views women theyre sex toys with thin revealing clothing with too much makeup and they have to shave in places where men dont have to fuck thati need to end it i dont want to keep going in circles i just want to forget about everything and not have to be reminded by my own brain about all the crappy things ive done the shitty event in my life which might be considered traumatic as i ironically feel a lot worse over it than the day my mom died but its all selfinflicted but no one will fucking get it and if i dare talk about it my identity is at risk of being exposed even though i wasnt that popularim not really suicidal amjust selfishwho gives a shiti meani amdepressed right but i havent even seen a therapist so how the fuck do i know if part of that isnt made up toowait why am i calling part of it realprobably because i know i have somethingits just not legit anymorei dont know if i will actually do it maybe i will maybe i wont like most times where i didnt i felt too shitty and lazy to do homework and i will fail my math test tomorrow and i dont knowi dont want to see the light anymore and convince myself not to dieisnt that wonderful not really but it sounds incredibly stupidlike againi ammaking this all up because i like feeling the pain otherwise i wouldve taken steps to improve my moodlike getting enough sleep and eating healthily and shitim not suicidal why am i doing thisfuck everythingi may or may not do this maybe i will just chicken out becausei ama loser i dont knowi think reincarnation exists though so maybe i will be able to try againi hope i wont fuck it upmy name is victoria and i ama confused selfish dramatic loser at least if i did this it would be the last time i hurt people even if it hits them hard it would be the last and theyd get over it

1,reincarnation sounds amazing the idea of a restart just by killing myself is too tempting i keep hearing stories that if you die and you get a restart what i would give to restart my whole life knowing whats going to happen to meeven if it isnt true death would better than my life now i was bullied for 10 years where i was pushed around and called names and all the effort i put into my studies and club which resulted in average grades and a meaningless certificate i lied to people that i had good grades before because it hurt admitting that there were nights i stayed up studying weeks before my major exams and it meant nothingi finally got out of that shit hole and i wasted my chances people kept complimenting me and i got arrogant and my short temper got the best of me my first friend i made in my new school was amazing she was there whenever i felt down and there for me when people pushed me around but she couldnt stand my attitude everyone kept warning me but only until i lost my friend did i realise what an asshole i amif i jump the pain would end at worst and at best i get another shot to make things right
1,my note is always bad and wrong just like me this fucking note just never sounds authentic and i dont know what advice to put after my death like wills what to do with my body song to play at my funeral and stuff like that i cant even put what i feel into words so is anyone ever going to forgive me but i cant live in agony been to councilling but it tells you things are difficult just power through them and thats it i mean its good for some just not me ive been told i will always feel like this ive just got to cope but i cant cope kill me
1,people say things get better but its not likei amever going to stop hating myselfi amsure that any problem i have with college trying to find a job or relationships is temporary but i hate myself and i always have i hate this depression i hate how ugly i am i hate how shy i am i hate how scared of everything i am i hate the random rage fits i have theres nothing that i like about myself and why should i expect that to change i cant just get rid of all these flaws theyre all part of me i hate myself more than anything on this planet every day i imagine taking a bunch of pills and oding but i dont have any to do it withi genuinely cant see why people like me like i have close friends who really like me and i have no idea why i suck

1,i literally dont know i cant explain whati amfeeling to anyone its the usual i have few friends none of them care about me i have a terrible family i have no motivation to do anything at all closeted gay in a homophobic environment obese and unattractive but i dont get it these things are all common i knowi am not the only depressed person in the world but i know that i dont relate or feel like any of them ive never been passionate about anything more than just dying i feel like i dont even want it to get better likei amliterally lusting over dying but i am too much of a pussy to do it ive really tried talking to people but i amaware of how much bullshit is passed on just to make people realize they dont actually wanna die which is true for some people but is it possible to be in a situation where death is the only option i just really really hate the idea of being alive and i am not even kidding the only thing keeping me alive is not being able to do the actual deed not because i dont want to but becausei amscared of it i feel like i have plenty of reasons to be depressed yet none of them are what makes me want to be dead it feels likei amjust not meant to be alive in some way and its soo hard to explain this without sounding weird idek whyi amwriting this guess i needed to vent
1,i want to be in pain sometimes my hands shake and i just want to smash them with a hammer i talk to myself so much but i dont really ever have anything nice to say to myself but i still feel likei ama better friend to myself than anyone else will ever be is there someone out there for me sometimes i really hope not i always convince myself thati ambest alone any time spent on me is time wasted i just want to diei amsure people would barely notice or care it seems that when people say they feel bad that someone they knew maybe at school or work kills themself its more selfish than theyd ever admit does anyone really care about my life or do they just care about the uniform routine of their own i feel like everyone would be more sad that now something is different people dont like change but a lot of people dont like me either so maybe my death would be a good change the kind that everyone wants in their life sometimes you want to become rich maybe famous maybe you just want to meet that special someone you just want to be happy you want your life to change in a good way i feel like everyone around me could only ever be happy if i died slowly and painfully maybei amtheir good change not my life but my death

1,i feel too much all the fucking time i have had debilitating anxiety and ocd since i was a kid at one point it became so overwhelming i fell into a horrible depression and tried to commit suicide years later i am no longer depressed at least i dont believe so but very often still want to kill myself part of it is my ocd some of my intrusive thoughts are suicide based but a lot of it comes from the fact that the anxiety and ocd entirely rule my life i cant get through college because i cant turn in papers and i cant navigate certain social situations because i cant seem to talk everything is too overwhelming with no perceivable future and the shame that comes along with that i just find myself wondering all the time if it would just be easier just not to exist anymore 
1,running out of ideas i feel like my entire life has just been distractions and procrastinating until one day i will run out of ways to put off suicidei amsick of saying i will just wait one more day i dont want to try anymorei am so exhausted i cant remember a time before i was depressed there has always been something wrong with me i wish i could rely on someone else for a few moments but i am too much of a burden to carry i ruin everything i touch and have no future i cant keep doing this

1,suicide option is liberating i know this sounds odd but it was so liberating when i determined that suicide was a realistic option for me now if i lose my job rather than trudge through the public embarrassment of losing my home and my family have to give up the cushy lifestyle we have now or making them move to a strange city there is a plan b suicide i kill myself and my family gets an instant financial windfall more than i could provide in 10 years so this realization has freed me up nowi amlike fuck it i started my own business on the side because if it fails who cares at worst i kill myself which is an option at best i am successful and can make my wife and kids proud of me knowing that i can always kill myself has also freed me up in how i deal with people too ive cut my abusive father out of my life because well why not if all goes to shit because i cut him out i just pull the plug and end itodd way to look at it but knowing that the worst thing that can happen is i die has liberated me in a way that nothing else has not thati amencouraging anyone to commit suicide get help your life is worth living even if mine one day wont be
1,been a while trigger i use to vent on here and the depression r reddit alot and for some reason id get alot of rude people commenting on my post but anyways i cant say that things have improved i had a rough time with the system when i started counseling last year i believe i dont know my mind is hazyi had two horrendous experiences with my first two counselors and during this my father got sick and passed away then i was told that i couldnt go there for counseling anymorelater on my significant other left me and i suffered until i reconnected with my close friend again and they helped me seek counseling but during this i got involved with someone who was bad for my mental health and i ended up overdosing again a few timesmy friend was supportive at first but they seemed to have burned out and i amunsure if my current counselor really cares about helping mei dont really have much faith in the system after everything that ive been through
1,amjust apathetic whats the point of being herei amjust here to make other people happy so long story short i had a boyfriend that i was crazy about i was actually happy for once in my life and felt like life had purpose we broke up after a year and a half about two months ago he told me that he wanted to marry me he almost proposed hes now dating another girl for a month now and has told her he loves her and wants to marry her i am not naive to think he really loves her the idiot just cant tell the difference between love and infatuation regardless hes still a happy idiot and i ammiserablesoi am going through the process of grieving i went crazy and was very close to killing myself the only reason i didnt is because of my familyi amgetting better ive had moments where ive accepted it and am ready to move on but the thing is i think this is the besti amgonna be until i find someone else like this is basically how i was before i met him just pretty apathetic about lifei amstarting to make friends and trying to better myself but for what so i can force myself to tolerate this life so i dont kill myself to keep other people happyi am in law school and i am trying to focus on the material and do the readings but i amfalling behind because i just dont care anymore i have to force myself to do this so i can get a job to support myself one day so i can tolerate this life sweetyeah maybe i will meet someone else one day that makes me feel happy like my ex did but what happens when he leaves too like my ex almost proposed to me everyone in my family loved him i thought everything was great between us then bam hes fallen out of love with me like fuck how am i supposed to trust after that and whats shittier is that i still miss him i tell myself over and over that i dont but i do i would probably take him back even though i tell myself over and over that i wouldnt or what if i never meet someone that makes me feel that way again thats whati ammost afraid of if i wanted to be in a relationship again i could just none of the guys have had that spark that i had with my ex i dont know what that spark is but i amaddicted to it like i literally could never get tired of being around my ex like i almost wish i was the kind of person who needed some space because i probably wouldnt be so fucked in the head but i could literally spend every moment with that person and feel happy of course theres fights and its not always roses but even the shitty times with him are better than these apathetic moments life felt like it had purpose now it feels like theres no point now its just me surviving and putting on a smile so other people arent sad which i mean i get it itd be selfish of me to trade my apathy for their sadness but this isnt fulfilling this is just being another number in the world i wish i just never existed that way no one could be sad over me because they never would have known me and i wouldnt hurt because i never would have known what life is i wish i wouldnt have screwed things up with him yeah he didnt buy me presents or do things that i wanted to do and thats shitty that makes me a pushover and pathetic but i was still happier being a pushover than i am for trying to have standards for myself we arent going to talk ever again we arent friends on facebook anymore and he blocked me on instagram the only communication i have left with him is just seeing his name pop up on the list of people who have viewed my snapchat story and you know how pathetic i am it makes my whole day when i see his name there its why i go out and try to have a life so i can post pictures on there and so hell see them and then i feel depressed until hes looked at it its pathetic and sad but thats what i am 
1,anything is there anything i could take or do i wish there was something i could take where i felt no pain just take it and go to sleepi amsuch a coward i know but man it would so much easier
1,not a goodbye just an acknowledgement hello i am relatively new to reddit and its a bit sad to say its because of this subreddit i have finally decided to become an active user not in the sense that this subrredit led me to becoming suicidal more in the sense that ive come to this website more and more to escape from my life and today was the culmination of all of it because ive found a place where i dont have to lie or pretend to be someonei am noti ama compulsive liar i suspect that is so because i want to retain a sense of control over my life but that is a topic for another time i still dont feel comfortable enough to post my own story here not that i dont trust the people here its just difficult for me posting something so personal somewhere so public which i know is paradoxical because its a public anonimity and everyones intention here is to help or to seek out helpfor themselves but still i have a hard time showing my own wounds to anyone but me in the mirror that sounded really cringy sorry about that what i really wanted to do in this post is to commend everyone that put time away just so they could help others that are going through similar situations the energy you guys dispense is your own you are sharing these beautiful sincere and absolutely touching messages of togetherness and understanding that you can hear these scattered individuals silent screams and that they sound unfortunately familiar to a lot of other peoples your fight is your own but the pain you feel is close to somebody elses that loneliness that separation everyone who has ever had something like this in their lives has gone through that feeling of an especially made pain for you dont hold on to it dont nurture it remember that many have beaten it so can you so can i so can everyone in this subreddit i am typing this message for you guys because you too deserve support i know for a fact youve saved lives but unfortunately people dont recognize you much for it and i know that is not the point nevertheless i admire your courage and perseverance you are amazing thank you for the ones in more precarious situations the ones that write or read for support of their own i have a bit of advice some days ago i was feeling especially down so i decided to walk alone i talk to myself a lot so i kept reciting these sad mumblings about my life to myself i just know that at some point i started to run with tears going down my face and with me just insulting life in general it helped there was a lot i had inside of me and fortunately it helped i have been worse than this bound to my bed empty and cold i can feel that coming back in those times i tried suicide never managed to go through but i ambeing completely honest what kept me going was a violent hatred for life fear and selfdoubt i dont have any selfconfidence so i just kept questioning my decisions strangely enough that helped me get through that rough patch the conclusioni am trying to reach is dont feel inadequate for your sadness dont feel like a coward for being afraid and dont feel like its your fault life is shit i know its easier said than done but truly remember you your body your mind whatever you want its fighting for you to stay alive your knowledge of your situation may help you help others your pain can one day become a strength unlike anybody elses if so many have battled through you can too youve taken a beating now use that blood to uh idk fucking skate over and punch life straight in the dick and if you need just come back herem and we will remind you why life is better than what it feels like much strength my dudes and wish me some too
1,just want to go awayi am17 years old male and i just want to go away again a few months ago i ran away from home because i was just done with life ive never had a reason to keep on living i just went through life without a goal i used to have a good amount of friends but they left me a year ago i made new friends and they left me too my life has only been downs and periods of time where its alright no positives i dont feel joy in livingi also feel likei am not allowed to make my own choices in life i have to follow all the rules that a couple of random people have decided on i dont really feel likei amliving my own life but while i was running away from home i did feel like i had the freedom to do whatever i want i liked that feeling but the police found me after i sent my location to one of my best friends who promised not to tell the police i felt betrayed and felt even shittier than before and since then december 2016 i havent had any positive moments in my lifei dont know what the fuck i want to do wheni amolder but i dont care anyway we all share the same ending to our life death so why not end it now or just make your own choices in what you want to do i really want to go away again either running away or just making an end to it altogether i know that some people will miss me but i dont want to stay just so i can make others feel better it sounds selfish but i wouldnt care anyway if i were deadgone and most of my friends already left me anywayi just want to go away
1,when you are the source of your problems most often people want to kill themselves because of problems coming to them like abuse bullying i willnesses etc but how do you cope when your problems are caused by you and only you i do cringeworthy shameful things and spill spaghetti out of my pocket way too often shame embarrassment regret and lowself worth run through my body everyday at a great intensity i dont feel any sort of direct sadness lonelines or grief so that probably makes my problems a little different from most others here i often invalidate myself because of this i feel like since every problem is caused by mei am not allowed to treat it like a problem but i am still allowed to validate my feelings this is a rational thought in my head so i guess thats a good start but i cant bring myself to feel it i still feel ashamed embarrassed regretful and of low selfworth all the timedoes anybody have any tips on how to overcome these feelings

1,lost everything becausei ama full blown narcissist the woman of my dreams a prospering career friends that people dream of having every moment is painful and it only gets worse and worse i want to end it but cant bring myself to do it that human will to survive is unbelievable why do you think youre a narcissist the way i understand things the vast majority of narcissists would never admit it which is why they cant ever get help and for donkeys ears it was believed that there is no cure for narcissism but apparently the underlying cause is recently assumed to be profound shame so heal the shame and cure the narcissism supposedlybut again most narcs never admit it which is why theres a high likelyhood that youre not so why do you think youre a narcissist

1,the past 6 months drained all of my energy i just wanna get this off my chest as i have nobodyi amwilling to talk to about thisi had to deal with health problems for a long time 8 years to be exact i wasnt able to go to school or work i sat at home all day and played games i lost a lot of friends was depressed and had my first suicide thoughts this is fairly irrelevant now but it may help to understand why i feel the way i do right nowin august 2016 i was finally able to start my apprenticeship as i was able to get my health problems under control i was able to work and go to school i gained new friends and good things happened in life by februarymarch i was happy with how things were going for the first time in 8 yearsbut then in april one of my best friends died in a motorcycle accident he lost control over his bike and hit an oncoming bus headon he died instantly this put me into a big hole my health problems started again i started missing at work sometimes i was in the office maybe 12 days a month i had to take medication to even make it to school i felt like complete shit during that time but did not have any suicide thoughts yet because everything else was going wellduring that time i lost contact to a girl i like a lot i dont have a crush on her or anything i just like her a lot as a person we talked and chatted a lot and everytime i was on the phone with her i was able to forget all my problems and it made me happy we talked about all kinds of stuff but i never told her this story but my constant asking to talk annoyed her a lot i could sometimes tell it did especially cause i knew she wasnt doing too well herself at that time but i still asked because i was depressed felt like shit and wanted to talk to someone to her she was the only person that could make me forget everything just before summer holidays we had a big falling out and we cut contact which made me feel even worse at firsti had 3 weeks of holidays in which i could relax and think a lot it helped me forget everything and feel a lot better but i couldnt forget her so before going back to school i texted her and we talked again i told her the whole story hoping shed understand why i acted like i did i told her thati amvery sorry i was a burden to her in a time she had to deal with her own problems i asked her if she could forgive me and give me a second chance she said shell think about it but 3 weeks later i know from a friend of her that she isnt really interested in keeping up contact with me anymorei am still in a big up and down rollercoaster from what happened in the past 6 months some days i feel great and the next day i think about how easy it would be to get rid of all my problems to forget everything i sometimes go days and weeks without being able to motivate myself for anything i just wanna lay in bed all day and cry but this with her this is really the last straw for me i have never met anyone who has such similar views about life and everything as i do i really miss talking to her on the phone or just chatting all day long i cant even put into words how much i regret everything i did i wish i could undo it but i canti could never do it myself i couldnt do it to my family my friends and everyone around me i know there will be better times eventually i have everything i could ask for in life but i amalmost hoping someone would run me over on my bike tomorrow and end my miserythank you for reading i already feel a lot better for now at least

1,amrunning out of energy ive been fighting this urge for so long i just dont know how much more i have in me i want so badly just to off myself but i dont want to abandon my family or put that burden on them so instead i wait here in this empty shell of a person hoping to simply fall over dead from some random wild disease but patience is not something ive really ever been good withi amat a fork in the road with the road ive already traveled crumbling behind and nothing but the choice of plummeting into an abyss or scaling an impossible cliff face in front of me i dont want to make the climb because i know for damn sure i will slip and fall but i cant go backwards because the road is crumbling and id just wind up back here in the future anyway i can make the leap into the abyss but i dont want my loved ones to follow me who gets to dictate this stuff who gets to decide what i do to myself certainly not anyone but myself yet somehow i feel obligated to stick around for the sake of my familys well being even though i dont contribute much at all 
1,help me take my mind off thisi amcurrently in the middle of a long journey by train after a distressing thing that happened earlier today i cant hold back the tears i want to cry and scream but i cant i feel helpless and the only thing i can think of is wanting to end the pain thats in my chest and stop the thoughts and thats the only thing that gives me comfort the thought that this can all end as soon as i get out of this miserable journey i dont really have the energy to type out the whole story here but suffice to say thati am tired of people i love treating me without any empathy at alli amon the way to having a good career and i amfairly talented but i feel that my life is a waste i smile at people at work all day and pretend thati amokay but i cry a lot i oftentimes take a walk alone and just cry my own family thinks that whatever distresses me isnt serious and sometimes say thati amjust messed up on the inside or if it were that serious id have tried to do something drastic already i see a therapist but i get no real help i almost want to end my life just to prove them wrongi want these episodes where i just cry cry and cry to just stop i feel horrible and helpless and it takes a lot for me to convince myself that tomorrow will be a better daythere are a few days wheni amhappy but every night before i go to sleep i always hope that tomorrow is not the day when it all ends again for me and then i go through days and days of just trying to survive because i have to the problem is i want to survive its just that people around me seem to try to do everything to prevent this whenever they figure out my vulnerabilitymy only hope in life is to be happy in the longterm but after many years of struggling i just want to know why shit always seems to happennow thati am trying not to cry in a public place where people are just trying to peacefully live their lives i think ive hit a new low that i didnt think was possible where i shed tears uncontrollably in a public place ive seen people laugh i hate myself and i hate that my life has taken this turnim expected at work tomorrow dressed up looking good and my suffering tonight will have been for nothing my life wont have changed and no one still understands my pain

1,suicide in every way except for actually killing myself yet hey guys this is just a vent type of post so sorry if i come across as annoyingas you may be able to tell from the title i am committing suicide in every way besides actually doing the deed i will not actually kill myself yet as i am still living with my parents i love them to death they are the sole reason i have not hungused an exit bag yet even though i have all of the materialsi am17 male and pathetic i would tell you guys why but its kind of complicated and i think i explained it pretty well in my other posts you could check them out on my profile if youd likebasicallyi ampurposely sabotaging everything i have its a form of self punishmentphysical sabotage i used to workout but ever since i had a mental breakdown about sports and weightlifting i have been eating just enough to survive i do this to lose almost all my muscle mass and athleticism for example used to have 34 standing vertical jump but now it is about 24 by an extreme caloric deficit i am working on becoming severely underweight malnourished and very weak to the point that walking is a chore basically imagine a skeleton with hair i have not been drinking much water either and am trying to stay in a steady state of dehydration again drinking just enough to stay alive i never exercise and force myself for example to take the elevator instead of stairs i know i am extremely lucky and fortunate to have a family that cares and access to all basic necessities but i reject them all i knowi amselfish and uncaring for doing these things but this is how much i hate myself ive even though about getting rid of an arm or leg by making a deep gash into my skin then exposing the gash to infectious diseases this would hopefully cause amputations i still take showers and brush my teeth because i hate being a nuisance to other people by smelling or something otherwise my body is a complete mess rightfully sofinancial sabotage i have a job in lawn care and make about 1250hr which is pretty good for now i am keeping my job for only 2 reasons reason 1 i am saving money to ease the financial troubles my family is going through divorce and both parents have low income reason 2 all the money left over i donate because i dont deserve any of it i feel better when i have no money in my wallet because i know thats what is right for meeducational sabotage i am a pretty good student 465 gpa and 32 act12 act writing thats great and all but this year senior year i am purposely trying to tank my grades i am trying to get all cs or ds so i can barely pass i like to see myself fail tests and assignments even if i know the answers i still choose the wrong ones my grades and act are from freshmanjunior year when i used to be ambitious and attempting to get into university of pennsylvania that dream is gone i do not want to be successful its not worth anything so since i have an all or nothing mindset i am choosing nothingrelationship sabotage this one is probably the least effective on me i dont have many friends but the ones that i do have i am breaking ties with i do things to make them think thati ama very mean and selfish person i sometimes talk back to my teachers to make them think lowly of me as well i still try to do the best for my parents by taking care of them and faking happiness so they can be happy i dont know if its working i dont care they have done so much for me i want to return the favor even if its not sincereso this is it guysi ammethodically ruining my life so suicide isnt that extreme when the time comes i will wait it out until i am as distant as ive ever been to my parents read halfway across the world with minimal contact in order to end it now is not the right time i just wanted to thank you guys so much for reading this far if you have it means a lot to me usually i write better but i have a time limit and i amtyping on the road at each stoplight so there are many breaks in my writing i will see you guys tomorrow no suicide here just eternal suffering 
1,whats the point ive hit that wall made some dumb drugdrink mistakes which led to bad choicesi amwithdrawing from alcohol and it feels awful i cant bring myself to tidy my room its disgusting i mean actually embarrassing not just messy ive let myself go these last few months have been awful i dont know where to start i need to lose weight i miss my anorexia it was like a friend my body hurts from constant laxative ods and right now i just need to ramble and writei am sorry its all about me i dont thinki ammeant to be alive if an animal was violent i will or just not functioning it would be humane to put it down so why not me 
1,ffff id fucking kill myself right now if i hade a private place to do it ohmygod i hate myself so much and i wanna die so bad
1,its not that big of a deali amconsidering suicide because i am an absolute failure at life failed academically failed socially failed everything theres nothing in my life worth salvaging i think about my family a lot what it would put them through and that blocks me from doing it committing to it but what harm is it to them really they will be depressed for a little while and then get over it my mother is the onei amworried about the most she is very weak mentally and wouldnt be able to get over it but at the same time she has religion and i think thatd give her strength i hope so at least ive considered writing in my suicide note that i asked for forgiveness for whati amabout to do and i am not a religious person but if asking for forgiveness helps my mother deal with it then id definitely do it my brother and sister would be depressed for a little while but i see them getting through it they are strong my dad would be angry at me and rightfully so but i dont think hed have a hard time getting over it ive thought a lot about losing out on happy experiences and all that but the way i see it its better that someone who is happy and fulfilled in life gets to experience those things instead and i know that those people are out there experiencing those things so its not so bad someone gets to do it it just wont be me i have a noose made and a place i want to go to do it but i dont think its long enough and i amafraid i will botch it theres also a shotgun in the house that i can use but itll be really hard to get access to it since my dad has hidden the key ever since my first attempti amterrified that my family will blame everything and anything and end up getting frustrated and angry at the whole thing but its entirely my own faulti amentirely to blame i want them to blame me but not hate me and i guess thats all i can do
1,diy how to survive i have wanted to kill myself for as long as i can remember since i was a kidi am26 now and dont know how to deal with it i have hurt myself in different ways many times over the years but havent made a full out serious attempt to kill myself because no matter how much i want to no matter how much i hate being myself i could not do that to my family i have an amazing family and i know that i am so privileged to say that they know that i have been depressed and support me when i told them thati amtaking antidepressants the treatment helps a lot but even after several months of increased medication i still think about how much i want to kill myself every day i dont know how to deal with it its a bizarre feeling because i know how i want myself to be and its really not hard its just beyond my grasp and i cant make myself be that person no matter how hard ive tried i dont want to try anymore i know i wont try to really kill myself because i truly do love my family that much but i am not sure how to handle these feelings i have already been seeing my doctor and shes a great doctor and knows everything i have told a few close friends about how bad it is and theyre very supportive of helping me get better but i dont know what to do next i just dont want to exist and i wish that there was a way that my loved ones would support it like when you have assisted suicide from a doctor and everyone is okay with it because they know how you are suffering and theres no chance of recovery i have been trying so hard to recover for so long i dont want to do it anymore 
1,there is no way i am surviving this school yeari am going to kill myself before june of 2018 i dont know when but i know it will be before then i cant take school its 7 hours 5 days a week plus hw i dont like most of my friends i will probably just end up with a shit 9 to 5 that i hate so i feel better off dead sooni amlosing a lot of my time to bullshit that i hate 
1,tell me suicide isnt the answer you cant plain and simple life is worthless we all die every single one of us whats the point of prolonging the inevitable what the hell does it matter if i die now or 50 years from now some of you might say what about how your loved ones would feel if you killed yourself well i will tell you this nobody really cares about anybody else but themselves this isnt coming from a place of angst but of truth human beings only understand the self its all we know as long as we arent 100 certain that the self is all that exists put simply my parents would only be upset because of how they would feel not because of any arbitrary love for me even more simply love is not real it is only a chemical reaction in our brains on top of this every single thing we do in life is just to get a rush of dopamine there is literally nothing else some of you will throw some feel good bullshit at me go ahead try and convince me life is worth living
1,at the end of my endurance i am a 24 yr old m i am severely depressedi cant get over how horrible this world is i hate it and most of the disgusting people in it i think people are awful and most of them are only out for themselves crushing everyone else in their wakei am offered nothing except for religious condolences from my parents who are the only ones i talk to any more it makes me fucking sick there is nothing more infuriating than being told everything will be alright by religious people fuck off i dont give a shit where people spend their eternity if it exists when people are cancerous to others around them they should be excised just like a tumor and the last thing i want to hear is that theyll get theirs that is such a cop out i cant even begini cant cope any more i dont have anything left i want to kill myself i dont think theres anything left on this speck of dust for me ive always been an outcast ive never been liked but i never hurt anybody i just keep to myself i dont know why everyone doesnt like me i just dont want to be in pain anymoredoes it get better or does it just keep getting worse i knowi am not old enough to know properly perhaps life hurts
1,hate myself ive had depression for 4 years ive tried almost everything i can to cure myself but everything in my life has gone wrong ive waited and waited and waited for some miracle or change of cicumstances to occur that will put an end to all the pain but ive finally accepted thati amdoomed to live a life of constant suffering and torment is that a life really worth living at this point i think the only winning move is not to play 
1,18m overdosed few days ago miraculously survived going to try again very soon i need help but it seems everyone who ive asked although empathetic has no idea of how i feel or why i want to die i suffer from these severe highs and lows with my mood fluctuating from extremely happyconfident and outgoing to 1 second later wanting to kill myslef i amjust done life isnt worth living if its like this and it seems no one understand whati am going through the next time i feel so lowi am going to do it and i will finally be set free 
1,to whoever this may concerni amending my life i wrote a detailed letter in here and then the battery on my phone died and now the entire long story is gonei will just make this short i stood by a woman who promised me loyalty and a better life and what i got is that she cheated and abandoned me wo car food or money and refused to take me to get pills i need and lied over over about taking me to the surgery i needed she cheated on me and tried everything to cause me to die getting in the way if medical needs and causing me to starve literally she refused to buy me food i was just abandoned while she is making over 7500 monthly income after taxes besides bonus she got a job as a director in a medical field she got that job because i lied for her by giving her a great review as a past employer i was never her employer she tried to kill me by stealing my cardiac pills she cheated on me started on thanksgiving with a subordinate asshole from that job she now has two incomes and two cars and i have nothing she preaches patient care to rge employees but literally caused situations over and over so i would die she actually tried to kill me in ways that would show as medical problemsi amnow in horrible living conditions toilet leaks snf rbe place smells like a sewer and i have no decision ability since i cant work she knew i cant work and told me after my open heart surgery that i will never work again abf that she will take care of everythingim miserable and tired of living i have no one to even write a goodbye letter toi amhomeless and hopeless i had a long detailed letter all typed out until the phone battery died and all the text was gonei want to die without anger i want to just cry but i cant even even do that i dont want to be in this world i dont belong here
1,self harm i don t do it often usually if i m drunk and feel alone and isolated but i don t consider myself suicidal at the moment i think i have seasonal depression and it s coming back but does anyone else self harm when they re drunk i can be hanging out with friends all night but the moment i m alone it happens i guess i m just looking for an excuse to do it i don t really know i kind of see the pain as a reality check if that makes sense it s a reminder to myself that no matter how happy i feel at the moment it s watching and waiting sorry for the weird post i just needed to say it 
1,what am i supposed to do wheni amliterally incapable of anything like seriously what is the point of living a shit youth suffering mental disorders physical defects massive failures just so that i can live a happy old life i dont see the point of all this the only reasoni amholding on rn is for the sake of my amazing parents they have done so much for me itd destroy them completely if i ended my pathetic existence this is so fucked up i cant live and i cant die too

1,i deserve it this past year has been rough i made a lot of friends and lost nearly all of them one after another for reasons ranging from disagreements about politics to someone legitimately trying to manipulate my friends into dumping me because they thought i was making everyone else depressed ever since then that person has been stalking me another person also started stalking me after they decided to end our friendship because i was being too nice to other people and he thought it was fake of me ive lost other friends countless friends throughout the years and these arent the ones that have hurt the most but theyre more in a string of bad endings to friendships that always seem to be my fault so ive been thinking i must deserve it i got up today thinking about ending my life and thats all ive been able to think about all day long my family would get over it my friends would find new friends if they havent already the people who live to torment me will probably be pleased as pie everyone can just go on without me and itll be fine the only thing stopping me right now is cowardice but i amseriously afraid that will eventually run out 
1,ama monster i dont deserve to live ive tried to put whati amfeeling into words but i cant accurately describe whati amfeeling its almost 4 am herei am not a native speaker and my mind is muddled by quetiapine but i need to get this ugly thing out of my chest basically ive been diagnosed with traits of bpdhpd not fully developed pds i display certain behaviours associated with those personality disorders and i feel likei ama bad person that deserves to die i want to gouge my eyes out tear my body apart and run away from myself ive been in therapy ever since i was 14 and ive still turned out fucked up there are tiny improvements but overall i feel i will never become a person that is worthy of having a happy life and being loved i mean all these years of therapy and no significant improvement i have a volatile relationship with my parents especially my motheri ama bad daughter and often i think itd be better for them if i died or killed myself i to kill myself if i cant be a good daughter a good person i dont even like a person i dont feel like a human being and i havent for a long time i feel like its not solid material things building my body but my selfhate and fear and anger and envyi am not even sure i can love maybe all i can feel when i love is an egocentric messed up childlike dependency maybe thats alli amcapable of if thats the case i absolutely do not deserve to have a family that loves me i dont deserve a life i genuinely dont want to die i dont want to notexist its a scary thought but i want to and deserve to kill myself i dont know how to help myself and transform my personality and maladaptive behaviours into something healthy and good and pure i honestly dont feel like theres an ounce of goodness in mei amjust a bad person trying but failing to be good theres not a single fucking redeeming quality about me except maybe the facti am trying to be better but i am not sure about that because i cant tell if its not just egodriven tbh i dont even feel i deserve to get better i promised myself i wouldnt be dramatic in this post but turns outi amstuck in my teenage emo phase also i knowi amhistrionic but i am not exaggerating for attention scouts honour i just needed to tell someone and i dont feel its okay to burden my friends with this and i amashamed of myself and i cant text my therapist at 4 amtldr i want to kill myself both as a punishment and because i cant live with myself please someone buy me tickets for a flight to destination not me tiai amexhausted i need a vacation
1,guys do you know some ways to get cancer this
1,i feel pathetic and lost hii amnew to reddit and sorry ifi am doing something wrong hereplease let me know my life is so pathetic and i honestly wish sometimes i dont know why i exist since grade school i was always the almost nonexistent friend that somehow gets bullied when i hit the spotlight for whatever reason ive left school twice to get home schooled and medical treatmenttherapy ever since ive always had a desire to be liked and known because of this whenever i see people i know having fun being surrounded by many people and exist in others lives i get extremely jealous i honestly feel pathetic that i even get jealous because i dont even deserve to be jealous prior to transferring to my current uni i was excited to start brand new and be part of the fun at such a prestigious university nowi ama senior and i am still alone with subpar gpa i regret everything ive done this past year because i havent done any impressive ecs low gpa and obviously no friends i feel so pathetic that i couldnt achieve a high gpa when i had no social life to begin withi amaiming for grad school phd but at this rate its probably impossible because of my below 35 gpa i constantly think about professors and grad students probably mocking me how i perform in classi amafraid of peers probably looking down on mei amconstantly overwhelmed with fear wheni amat school i was actually blessed to have a friend for a few months but one day i was shut down by the friend because i was pathetic weakwilled egocentric good for nothing this happened when i reached out to the friend when i was suffering with depression and anxiety after that it has scarred me tremendously and ive became afraid to be friends or open up to anyone now i spend everyday alone ive lost touch with all my friends from back home after moving i cant stop thinking about how my grades are poor the loneliness and my selfworth i honestly feel like i have no talent in anything and it makes me wonder what purpose i serve in this world i really feel like a good for nothing just like the friend said i dont have or ever had anyone who would even care about me i cant stop thinking about ending everything probably the only thing i would miss holding me back is my parents and boyfriend that i semitrust but i cant seem to have enough energy to continue and care about them i probably am egocentric because i pretty much can only care about how i feel and what i want i can only seem to care about the happiness that will come out of suicide i just really want to disappear
1,i dont know whyi ammaking this i guess its a last ditchi amvery near killing my self ive struggled with a gun to my head countless times never having pulled the trigger my fianc aborted our boy without telling me and then left mei amabsolutely dead inside the only thing i feel at all is morbid depression she was my life we were starting a family i loved her more than life in every sense of the term i miss her a disgustingly my world the other morning i woke up in the hospital with no one around confused as to where i was and how i got there until i looked on a tray besides me and saw my empty bottle of adavan and pain killers looked in my phone and saw some pretty cold texts between the two of us pieced it tougher i went on suicide autopilot and swallowed enough prescription drugs to kill a horse i dont know how it didnt work it made me sick i gathered my shit from the room and left without saying anything to anyone these last few days have been getting worse and i dont think theres anything left for me i love her so damn much and she killed our baby without even telling me i want to die i dont see any way around it i know people have been through worse than this but i amjust not strong enough i know i will hurt people but i want this disgusting pain to be over

1,developing schizophrenia i am losing reality every day that goes by i hear voices daily theyre not next to me theyre not whispering in my ear they are always outside of my room door in the kitchen in the vents ive seen a screaming face come out of my poster in my room i have seen an arm reach toward me coming from out of my curtain i have extreme paranoia i can not trust anymore i do not trust my girlfriend even though she says she promises to not do things that will hurt me all of her friends hate me apparently my paranoia makes me a horrible person my paranoia is completely justified to me i am absolutely right the entire world saysi amwrongthe only thing i am able to do that makes me feel better is remembering the thought of judgment day coming anyone who has hurt me and brought evil to the world without an inquiry of forgiveness or guilt will be dealt with and all of the pain and suffering will be brought to an equilibrium by justice may god accept my never ending plea for forgiveness and may he protect me from all evil including whatever my never stopping thoughts arei will not suicide its a sin but wow how beautiful the thought is to leave this worldly life theres too much suffering for me to handle
1,my parents dont seem to understand they dont seem to understand that if you yell at your child for using depression as an excuse for everything call them a lazy piece of shit or say she says she has depression but wont say why shes depressed its disgusting that just makes me not want to tell them i want to kill myself as well so much for having loving and supporting parents
1,amclose and it scares me i recently started college and quickly made some friends they were nice but when feelings of depressionsuicide returned i pushed them away so nobody at my school would care when i die i will just b that kid that not many people knew that killed him self during 1st semester without friends all i think about is suicide i took a run through the woods today to scout out trees that could handle my weight when i hang myself i hate myselfi ama burden on other people and theyre better off without mei amjust a pussy that needs to go die
1,am not good i dont really have problems with confidence in myself or with talking to people i just often decide what i have to say isnt worth wasting peoples time with though i guess maybe that is a problem with confidence i dunno i feel confident i just feel likei ama waste of chemicals and i want to die

1,first suicidal thought in seven months hello last year i suffered a concussion that gave me some awful symptoms including brain fog memory loss decline in social skills extremely uncomfortable feelings in the back of my head and more it was too much to cope with especially after 4 months of going to doctors and not getting any diagnosis i decided killing myself was the only way to escape my seemingly eternal condition i set a date in may and started planning around february i started feeling a little less bad and the doctors also prescribed me some medicine and exercises to get me on the right track so i stopped feeling suicidalat some point during the first four months when i was still trying to figure out what exactly was wrong with me i visited an ent and he prescribed me nose spray which ended up having nothing to do with the problem i started noticing some weird feelings in my nose and ear after taking it for a couple weeks so i stopped the nose feeling never really went away though fast forward about 6 months and i was almost fully healed from the concussion symptoms all of the sudden the nose symptom got a lot worse my entire left nostril felt like the contents had been sucked out of it with a vacuum and now the flow of air is way too strong all of the air flowing in makes both my throat dry and soar all the time and creates this irritating scrapey feeling above my left ear on top of that it seems like some of the brain fog symptoms i was describing earlier have returned along with this thing and i feel like my entire head is a mess againim currently visiting some doctors to see if they can provide any insight but dealing with it for a month and only seeing it get worse is really demoralizing i feel depressed and anxious constantly and kinda feel like i wanna die again idk how longi amgonna be able to hold on this time if my body keeps bombarding me with all of these symptomsjust really needed to vent somewhere thanks for reading
1,nothing is getting better everything i try and do just blows up in my face my friends are leaving me life is pathetic and pointless all i ever wanna do now is smoke weed constantly to get through and half enjoy the day my life is going nowhere man god i hate it here 
1,trying to take the emotion out of it i gave been miserable for awhile now i dont know why but i cant remember the last time i was actually happy despite this i am trying to look at my life logically while removing the emotions from the equation i dont see a path to me being happy i am not that interested in my job it pays well but i dont really enjoy it to be honest i have never had an answer to the question what do you want to do when you grow upi am33 now and i still dont have an answer i dont hate my job but it is just something i do to pay bills the only good thing about my job was this one person i work with long story short i caught feelings for her but she had a boyfriend we became really good friends and she is single now but i am too much of a coward to make a move plus i want her to be happy and i dont think i could make her or anyone happy the hobbies i used to have dont interest me anymore either i used to spend hours and hours playing video games with my brother and friends but about a year ago i completely lost interest in them i try to play them now and i just get bored i also used to be a huge sports fan i would watch football and basketball and pay attention to all the news in the offseason now i could care less i am in a fantasy football league and dont even know what players are on which team anymore i have lost interest in life and am just miserable on most days i recently moved away from my friends and family to try to put some distance between us i want them to get used to the idea of not having me around i would like to be around to see my nephews and niece grow up but when i really think about it they will be better off without me i dont want them looking up to me in anyway and wanting to be like memy plan is to get through this holiday season and then i will probably end i all sometime early next year there are some people at work i want to set up to get promoted that really deserve it in the next couple of months i am also going to be really stingy with my money so i can leave some for my family i plan on buying a one way ticket to a country in europe and ending my life over there i will ditch all my ids and then kill myself my hope is that my body wont be identified and my family can always have hope thati am still alive i dont even really know why i am writing this i guess i am just venting i dont see my life getting any better and i dont have any motivation to go on the way things are i am trying to be logical about this please let me know if there is any fault in my thing
1,want to die life isnt worth living dropped out of college due to anxiety stuck at the same job for years nothing is getting better just someone convince me to just fucking end this becausei am too much of a bitch to just do it myself
1,just tried killing myself feeling even worse first off i have social anxiety and depression ive never really been very confident around people or by myself for that matter so doing things that seem basic and trivial to most people is always very challenging ive had depression for just over a decade seen several therapists and even tried helping myself by trying to be more active and outgoing but ultimately i will just end up repeating a cycle of being happy for a while and then horribly sad as i start to doubt whether i can truly stay happy that these people around me dont really care about what happens to me that theyre not really hanging out with me because they want to but out of pity that my moods are ruining everyone elses vibe that whether a small mistake i made still gets talked about behind my back that i have no value as a friend or lover or person that when i try to commit suicide i cant even do that becausei am too much of a coward and just feel like dead weighti am so lonely and scared i cant trust people because of a rough childhood growing up in a bad neighbourhood and mostly experiencing betrayal and verbal abuse and its killing me inside i made this throwaway so that maybe at least someone could see this i really dont know what to do anymore
1,titanic so e has been doing a marathon of movies lately and one of them is titanic does anyone else find roses suicidal tendencies incredibly romantic and enticing her life is perfect but she cant keep herself off the edge i found it highly relatable
1,anybody else feel this way my thoughts have been possessed by suicide ideation whenever i mention this people say i have so much to experience i am only 14 but i dont want to not be suicidal until i ultimately find get a gun and kill myself impulsively for i believe that happy people are delusional filth suicidal thoughts are enlightenment and it is ignorant to try and get rid of them only reason i havent killed myself through a nonimpulsive way is because iwant to read on suicidea discourse on voluntary death to improve my note quality sadly my parents refuse to let me buy it does anyone agree with my sentiments or am i just crazy
1,honestly dont know how to cope with life anymore i honestly never thought id be typing on this subreddit the fact that i am makes me feel even worse i feel guilty because part of me loathes selfpity but i am scared that one of these days i might actually do something really dumb thats whyi amhere this is my first post on this site i literally made an account so i could talk to someone to give a little bit of a backstory because i didnt just wake up like this will probably be helpful i have a history with depression and anxiety i have a history with abuse selfabuse self harm abuse from others ive been romantically involved with and sexual abuse from my childhood now on paper or online that all seems really dark and it is but it doesnt encompass who i am and looking at me youd never be able to telli am an above average attractive 24 year old woman i have very strong metaphysical beliefs and i honestly believe in the good of mankindi amintelligent ive had to fight to get where i am mentally and emotionally to come off as really stable i moved states a year ago to start over and moved to an amazing major city with 400 in my pocket and i made a life for myself here i finally started living a life that i thought i deserved a month ago a girl ive been friends with said to me i honestly dont how youre so stable and inside i chuckled to myself because she like everyone else only sees the surfacei amwhat youd call a functioning depressive to put things in perspective if any of you have ever taken a meyersbriggs personality testi am an enfp robin williams was an enfp my number one goal is for people to not see me suffer because i never want to make anyone sad i hate asking for help i hate telling peoplei amsad to guilt them into wanting to be around me i know its very selfdestructivei ama very selfaware person i was in counseling and also saw a psychiatrist about a year ago because i barely felt like i could keep my head above water i was diagnosed with bipolar type 2 disorder with depression an a general anxiety disorder i scored very high on a dissociation test i would be in the middle of work and kind of black out and forget what i was doing two minutes later ive almost gotten in car accidents because of that as well it makes me seem very spacey and ditzy at times when really i just go somewhere in my head without my permission because its how i learned to cope with trauma as a child my best friend tried to kill herself last december as well shes my roommate and i found her in the bathtub full of blood and had to drive her to the hospital after it had snowed 6 inches the night before december of 16 was my bottom so i started medication to be honest it really fucking helped it got me out of my head enough to focus on my job i got back together with someone who i was very fond of that initially ended because of my instability and things were going great i felt like november december 2016 was my bottom and i fought my way out and got to a stable place then may 17 happened i started to wean back on my medication because i didnt feel like myself anymore i was still in counseling trying to cope with what happened to me in my childhood and deal with that but i didnt feel any emotions i couldnt cry anymore i would be in a room full of people having an amazing time and pretending i felt something so i started to correctly wean off of my meds i had been on them for less than a year and i read how to properly decrease my dose to avoid harsh sideeffects about a month after i completely quit i felt back to me without the ups and downs i could paint again i paint quite frequently and the medication made me not want to do that anymore i could cry and most importantly i could feel things but it got worse i couldnt control my emotions anymore in a responsible way i would lash out at the people i cared about about what i mean 50 of it may have been legitimate things part of subconsiously hating yourself is attracting not so loving people into your life or people who are just as good at suppressing emotions as you are 50 of it was also me lashing out because everything the medication suppressed was and is now at the surface so i ruined a relationship with that guy he wont speak to me anymore which is fine i dont think we were meant to be romantically anyways but i apologized to him a month and a half later for the bad fall out we had and he never said anything i felt really stupid for that and internalized it as something very idiotic that i did i have always tried to escape these issues through relationships i have attachment issues my love language is quality time so i tend to kind of monopolize a new person or a personi amromantically involved with with wanting to spend time with them like all the time part of this is just how i bond part of this is also escaping myself i have recently been involved with a person now for a couple months i dont know if he emphathetically understands these issues not that its his responsibility to fully grasp them but in this situation ive tried to be very selfaware so i dont do those things like lash out etc this person has been of great support to me he has helped pull me out of neutral i have started to find purpose in myself again and a reason for being here today i lashed out at him for something very trivial we are not officially dating because were millenials and its only been a couple months but i love his family they love me i love his dog we spend a majority of our free time together and i find that we really compliment each other in so many ways i truly adore him of course there is a catch when i met this person he told me that he might be going to europe for an extended period of time in the fall so thats part of the reason we to keep it casual but it just ended up getting more serious and eventually his me statements became we statements i sometimes feel with this person i am on a rollercoaster once we started to get more serious he kind of pulled back to make sure he was making all the right decisions regarding his emotions and my emotions i respected that but with all of my relationship insecurities i saw it as a big red flag that hes just going to dip out come time hes reassured me that he could never rid me of his life but maybe that isnt good enoughi am looking for something to give me purpose so i dont kill myself one dayi am looking for it in the wrong places and the wrong people and i amaware of that but old habits die really hard its like watching a character on a movie screen make all of these mistakes and from the theater youre yelling stop doing that but they just keep doing it over and over again part of me thinks i should cut things off to save him from me to save myself the inevitable heart break i will no doubt feel when he decides to leave for europe without me part of me knows i lash out because yeah i am insecure as f about where the relationship is going but also because i have deep seated emotional fears i fear that i will be forgotten i fear that i will drive everyone away from me i fear that even when there is a light at the end of the tunnel my destructive patterns will not let me see it because the dark and malicious part of my personality wants me to feel absolute misery it has convinced me that is a safe and inevitable state of mind believe me when i say if you met me youd think i was the queen of positivity i want everyone to experience love and to feel loved for some reason i wont allow that for myself and it kills me suicide at this point albeit fucking terrifying for so many reasons seems less and less terrifying each and every day the first time the thought crossed my mind i was freaked out now its where my mind jumps to the peace that i would feel even for a millisecond of not having to upset anyone anymore i have a very loving and supportive family but they dont know any of this my best friend is doing great now from her dark time back in december and i feel like if i bring anything up its going to remind her of that and send her into a relapse i bottle all of this up i even asked the guy thati amseeing to see him because i felt scared to be alone because of my thoughts but he said that he thinks its best if we both have space tonight because of how i lashed out at him earlier so nowi amembarrassed i feel guilty for even bringing that up to him i feel like he doesnt care does anyone i guess whati am looking for is for a reason not to do it eventuallyi amopen to anything really i wouldnt be here posting this if i didnt feel so low maybe someone can also direct me to a subreddit with supportive females or supportive people with experience with childhood sexual abuse trauma i internalize everything everything ends up being my fault even when it isnt and its a vicious cyclei amjust hoping that before i choose to like literally end my life i keep going on the off chance that something good will happen howi am not seeing that i dont get it but i just dont at the moment 
1,its just been so longi am so tired of dealing with this with mental i willness and insecurities and anxiety attacks i just want to make it stop already
1,ive wanted to kill myself every day for 7 years every single day but i ama coward this is my balance youre not a coward for wanting to live use that inner strength to better yourself as a person
1,told everyone i want to die still want to die it just came spilling out of me one night when talking to my mom then i stumbled into telling an empathetic acquaintance when i asked her for advice on something over drinks a few days later during an anxiety attack a friend messaged me and i impulsively told her that ive been suicidal for the past year and that i was having a mental breakdown and nowi amtelling you internet strangerim not sure what i expected to get out of telling people i guess i was looking for some reason to live to just hit me but it hasnt now i just feel more trapped than ever if i kill myself nowi am going to cause any immense amount of pain and guilt my death wouldnt have been painless for my parents anyway which is why ive forced myself to live for so long but now i would be a complete fucking asshole for killing myself after i told them i think the problem is that i now feel obligated to improve and i dont know how to do that ive been seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist for a year now changed therapists 3 times now insurance issues long story the drugs dont work though and as for the therapy the simple fact is that you cant decide for someone that their life is worth living i have been suicidal many times over my life but they were at emotional crisis points when i hated myself i dont necessarily hate myself now i just havent thought life was worth living for a year now and i still dont food is unappetizing nothing is funny anymore i dont get joy from anything all that remains is an obligation to others thats all i have left 
1,i wanna kill myself so desperately i am absolutely tired of this loneliness this lack of human connection and compassion the fact that i am unlikable and cant talk to people i dont see any future for me i dont see how i can survive the adult world as i am not a competitive person and my social skills are down the drain i cant do anything right success and love of any type just seem like they werent meant for me i wanna die sooo bad but i dont wanna hurt my family i am waiting till the latter half of my 20s to commit suicide i am 20 so maybe i can give life a chance but i cant wait till then for now i will just hope something kills me i dont know how much longer i can take this i am sooo 110 fucking done

1,i dont know how to open upi ama 19 year old college student and ive had this problem for my entire life i dont know how to be open about how i feel i was bullied and neglected by my friends throughout high school and middle school and i feel like this and past painful experiences have made me too afraid to tell people wheni amupset or how i feel about things in general my college friends have been nice to me but i feel likei amstarting to be neglected by them too because i constantly feel likei ambeing left out of their conversations and when we hang out they hardly talk to me i always come up with witty jokes to make them laugh and they often tell me how talented i am but i feel likei amjust an entertainer to them rather than a friend i want to be able to have real conversations with them and tell them how i feel but they always ignore me and drown me out i have aspergers which makes this especially difficult because sometimes they get impatient with how slow i am to say things and also it sometimes doesnt come out quite right and they dont fully understand whati am trying to say when i do manage to get something out just being around them feels so degrading if i talk about wanting to kill myself or being depressed they thinki amjust joking so they think nothing of it and carry on talking to each other when we get drunk together is the only time i have enough courage to say how i feel but i am still drowned out if i had access to more alcohol id probably have a serious drinking problem because the only time i feel released from the pressure of social anxiety stress and negative thoughts is wheni amdrunki amunable to ease my depression from crying because i feel likei amno longer physically able to its the worst feeling being trapped inside your own mindmaybe i dont give them enough to work with to deserve their care or respect i sometimes feel like i dont give them enough of my attention to deserve theirs i think of committing suicide all the time but ive never gotten enough courage to try it but i feel like i wont be able to live like this for much longer because i will soon have to face this while dealing with trying to find a decent job and facing the world
1,this could be my last night i don t think i can control myself anymore i don t trust myself to not do it i ve been depressed for a few years now not diagnosed because i don t dare to talk to anybody about it i try to keep up a facade about being happy i want people to like me i don t think many people know how i feel a few close friends might have figured it out i m not sure i m not sure why i m depressed i don t have any good reasons i ve never had any problems getting friends or girls even though i ve never had a relationship so i don t understand why i fell this wayone year ago i moved away to college and it s not going well i m failing classes and most days i don t even leave my bed some friends in class have asked why i m not going to the lectures but i make up excuses to seem cool some days i put a knife to my throat just because i like the feeling of being in control of my own lifethis story is probably incoherent and missing a lot of details but i just wanted to express how i feel my first language is not english and i m drunk at this moment sometimes when i drink alcohol i forget how i feel but most times it just makes it worst i think it s part of the problemanyways thanks for reading this might have been the last thing i m ever going to write i m not sure yet

1,i think i m already dead and i must have done something really awful stuff to be sent to hell this constant and never ending circle of hopelessness loneliness false promises making me believe even just for a fraction of a second that there is a way out when there isn t teasing me and then laughing in my face when i realise it s all lies i have done something horrible and i m already dead and hell is nothing like i imagined there are no fires and burning for all eternity just a repeating simulation of life and then ripping the dreams and hopes out of my heart to punish me for my existencethinking back all the way to my childhood i had dozens of surgeries even before i was 6 promising me to fix me but then another surgery and another promise i started school and started it again at another school going to high school and finishing it at a second one then more surgeries more promises to be normal more false hopes to ever being a father only to be laughed at when people realise what i was born with or without going to uni and taking that away from me then a second uni and taking that away from me too working my ass off to build up a career and either let me screw up or snatch it out of my hand so everything i ve built and worked hard for comes crushing down on me over and over and over and over againwait until i just about to have enough give me something to hold onto watch me build something again and then just when i start to feel it s worth living take it away and throw me back into the pitschools jobs relationships hobbies friends crushes love none of that is real just tools of torture that is out of my controland the only way to break that cycle is to kill myself again then erase my memory grown up again torture me again then kills myself again and the circle never endswhat other explanation is there i know it s my fault it has to bei get the message whoever sent it to me i must do a reset soon die again by my own hands get sent deeper into the bowls of hell and see how long it takes until i realise again i need to die once more and again and again and againi have a countdown a deadline i set years ago i need to bring it forward and stop waiting stop trying stop living just stop

1,i almost killed myself last night i had the razor ready to slice down my wrists but i couldnt do iti am too much of a fucking failure to even follow through with it i hate myself
1,no safety thank you for reading i feel like i have no one that understands or gets it ive always been extremely anxious ever since i was around 5 years old and i have been depressed since about 11 years old ive had recurring suicidal thoughts since about 13 i am now 24 and i wasnt diagnosed with chronic major depression until a couple of years ago ive had my first attempt last year i had a very intense fight with my mom she was listening in on me telling my boss that i need a break from work because of my mental health problems my goal was to end my life after that fight but i still dont believe it was an attempt i cant wrap my head around the fact i did attempt suicide because nothing happened i didnt end up unconscious or anything from the half of bottle of pills that i took i could hear my mom saying she wanted to kill herself and my dad telling her to put down the knife i snapped out of whatever mental break i had when i took the pills and i told my dad what i did he drove me to the hospital afterward i was treated evaluated and was voluntarily committed to another mental hospital for 2 weeks the treatment i received worked for some time but my depression came back around june my suicidal thoughts started in july and i have been cutting again to cope my family isnt exactly supportive i have an older brother who has problems too but he is basically verbally abusive towards my mom and i he will call me anal whore slut and use christianity to put me down hes not even a christian i am not comfortable dating or having relationships so i dont at all he constantly brings up the one and only guy i went out with a few years ago to tell mei amforever his bitch he would text me offensive and creepy things before i started forwarding his texts to the rest of my family they wont do anything he is literally a troll he will constantly say the exboyfriends name or call me a bitch if my parents arent around he would make kissing noises and faces at me if i was around or drive by him he has said unprovoked that i should kill myself after i was out of the hospital he cant keep any job and lacks any kind of common sense or respect he will act like a crazy jerk in our house but he will quickly act normal if he is outside of our neighborhood my dad tells me to ignore him but how do you ignore something like that he wont bother or threaten my father or other brothers he is about 6 and my mom and i are under 52 he has smacked my mom in the face before and i have gotten into physical altercations with him as well my dad is usually there to stop them but he doesnt have much authority ever since the police told my father the owner of the house can kick my brother out hes stopped caring because its my mothers responsibility they keep allowing him to come back i dont feel safe in my house or in my neighborhood anymore the boy and i use to ignore each other if we ever cross paths but he now makes it a point to harass me even outside i am constantly looking over my shoulder he has even attempted to walk in the middle of the road if he sees me driving down the street and he will do something obnoxious when i drive by him anyway my mom will constantly say hes not normal but she allows him to continue living here she owns the house and i cant stand her enabling him my brother is aware of this and he has recently started shouting at my mom no power i literally have nowhere else to go and i dont have a car i feel trapped i have a moderate to severe autoimmune disease and it can prevent me from going to work or school i feel like between my depression disease shame and crappy family that i would be better off dead if he went away life wont be as depressing and i can effectively deal with my other personal issues more often i was already depressed before he started becoming a monster but it feels like there is no safe place to recover with him lurking in the house sorry for the long post thank you again for reading

1,realisation time to vanish were to startive got bipolar and whilst writing thisi amon a serious down so its a struggle to even attempt to express my feelings but i feel kinds hopeless i believei amonly truly happy when ive got something to look forward too that thing was university this has suddenly been snatched from me as i was not invited to join back the second year of my college course reasoning behind this is because i work 50 odd miles away from the college and unlike students therei amolder 21 so have responsibilities and such luckily ive been offered a position at another college to do their send year this means though my job i currently have wouldnt be possible to do anymore as its too much of a journey so that part is really getting me down and also ive had a really rough time whilst being at my parents house my mother despises me and my farther left before i was born and refuses to acknowledge my existence meaning the 2 people who are meant to be there for me dont give a shit it sucks because me and my mum used to be inseparable and she was like my best friend now she wont even answer me when i talk to her just ignores me so leaves me feeling alone i also have a girl ive been seeing but because of my bipolar it makes not so hard to even show emotion towards her i dont miss her and that worries me but i just dont feel it i wouldnt be upset if she left me but i dont want her too i just want to feel normal and not a emotionless twatfeel like theres nothing left we live we die whats the point of waking up unhappy 
1,sucidal thoughts i m 20 i currently work in retail after leaving a web development job which i didn t enjoy so i left after a week it gave me depression feeling like a guinea pig i ve been dating my girlfriend for 8 months now she s 18 and i ve been living at her parents house since we dated my mum has a two bedroom flat but she keeps meeting random guys and sometimes i hear them having sex and it gets to me she s a single mum as my dad left me at child birth we don t really get on and talk rarely my girlfriend is now going to university left today and i ve depended on her so much for happiness that i don t know how to be happy without her we ve talked about the future to the point of me engaging her in a few years time i m moving by chance to a new job opportunity 20 minutes away from her but will only be on the odd occasion be able to see her on the weekends and i can t cope with the idea of that i trust her but i depend on her and i fall down the ditch of suicidal tendencies when i m alone i ve researched what i can do and where i can get the equipment i ve not discussed this with her because i m not here to blackmail someone into submission that s both selfish and weak on my behalf i worry that no job will satisfy me and i m in an endless loop that ll make me unhappy i m not happy with that amount of time i ll be able to see her compared to other people and i just can t live happily with myself as i feel like i ve been born to die i never seem content with what i have and i can t cope alone and alone is exactly what i m going to be is it really so bad just for me to call it quits i ll break her heart but i feel like there s no other way and that this is the end i can hand on heart tell you now that if she broke up with me that i would 100 end it i m not waiting for that eventuallity because i know she isn t the type but i feel like i need to do this for me people are born for every statistic to be killers and everything else and i feel that because of how my life has affected me that only death can set me free but i always think this way when i m down but maybe this is the bullet that ll get me out i m just not sure what to do and everything seems to lead to my unhappiness and abandonment issues to get the end of me edit we have spoken about how i am as i lost the will to live when she went away on a holiday it s not jealousy it s just me not being ok with myself i tell her i don t want to talk to her about my problems all the time because that pushes people away even if they say it doesn t
1,i just want someone to talk to i dont want to do this alone i finally built the courage to tell the one person that i can go to that i was going to kill myself he blew me off now i have nobody i know its pathetic but i just need someone to talk to i just dont want to be completely alone when it happens
1,nothing changes i used to be a drug addict and dealer i hated my life and everyday i hope i would find the drive to kill myself or overdose one day i thought it was my rock bottom nowi am sober and somehow managed to get to a job the pays extremely well but i still want to die more now than back then every single day for most of the day i think about it i look at myself in the mirror and i want to put a bullet through that persons headi amscum and i dont deserve life love happiness friends and family i cant keep on like this for much longer i already have for far too long
1,how to stay happy i have posted on here several times before each time i have been talked out of killing myself however i am tired of being talked out of it i want to either stop being miserable or just die i recently quit my job at mcdonalds because it was making me more suicidal than ever and have been going to college i am scared of my horrible grades as i think i may go on academic probation after that i will have large student loans pilled up on my head no job and no way to ever get a job that isnt a dead end job that makes me want to kill myself therefore i have decided if i go on probation i will kill myself i have gotten obsessed with the idea of death lately i think about what death would be like and ways i could quickly die about 70 of the day what is bothersome to me is that other people who have the same situation or even worse situations are able to stay happy this is frustrating to me not because these people are happy but because i feel like i am completely missing something that these people are is it genetic is it a mindset if it is either how could we ever change our mindsets or genetics after all we are who we aretldr i am extraordinarily unhappy because of many situations and am likely going to kill myself at the end of the semester unless i can find a way to stay happy i am tired of being talked out of it this is a final decision instead i want advice to be happy
1,i think ive realized what hurts the most about all of this and thats that i didnt even get a choice i was born with this difference disorder i willness whatever you want to call it i didnt get to choose to be normal and even if i had started the treatment options earlier my body and mental health would have always been fucked i cant stand being trans if i wake up tommorow still feeling dysphoria i might really end it 
1,i think my mom is going to kill me i dont want to die right now i love my friends too muchbut i might have to my sisters boyfriends mom wants to talk to me i am in a mental health awareness club that my mom doesnt know about and so is my sisters boyfriend my mom is deep in denial that i have any kind of mental i willness and has invalidated me mocked me screamed at me and threatened to hurt me for showing signs i wasnt supposed to let anyone at school know i have to find places to hide ifi am going to break down at school because if the counselor knows my mom will somehow find outmy moms on the phone with his mom right now the club is the only thing my sisters boyfriend and i have in common if my mom finds outi am not sure what shell doi am going to try to tell her its just for leadershipto help friends but i am really scared my mom screamed at me and called me a lazy ass because i told her i was slightly anxious about school i dont know whats going to happen and i dont want to live in an environment where its not safe for me in any way i dont want to live thinkingi amalone in this if my mom finds out i think i will have to or i could just not live at allto whoever is reading this i love youi am sorry you were brought to this sub and i hope with all my heart things get better for you i am going to do my best to stay alive for my friends and i hope youll find a reason as wellill try to update thisthank you for listeningedit it was a false alarm she wanted to talk about something elsei am so relieved but my heart is still racing it sucks to be living in an environment that scares me as much as it does but thank you for caring you guys were there even when i thought i was going to die that means a lot to me thank you i love you guys
1,i am tired of being transgender my biggest problem with being trans is that i feel no one believes me even cis people that understand or say theyre an ally it feels like everyone around me thinksi amcrazyi am not really a woman trapped in a male body i just think i am and you know what maybe its truebut that doesnt make it hurt any less every time i see a group of girls talking about nothing knowing that i will never join them never be one of them it feels like being punched in the gut and it doesnt go away everyday again and again ifi amjust crazy its damned persistenteverything i see online and at work tells me that the trans community will never be accepted feminists see us as men and dont want us anywhere near them lesbians see us as men and i amattracted to girls lucky me s men just see us as gay gay guys want to drop the t from lgbt altogetherthe only treatment for being transgender is to transition but asi amconstantly reminded that wont make me a real woman so whats the pointand so this is why i want to kill myself its become increasingly obvious to me that trannies have no place in this world i have no place in this world and i amdone fighting my dysphoria everyday only to be mocked and told thats its not realits just not worth it anymore
1,i hope i get killed before i kill myself someone pm me please i dont want to do iti dont want to die at all i just want the pain to end if i die i want it to be quick like a car crash i could handle that because at the end of the day my mom wouldnt be the mom with the depressed kid shed be the unlucky mom there wouldnt be anything she couldve done to prevent it i dont want my friends beating themselves up over a problem they couldnt fix theyd remember the good qualities i had the school wouldnt have any class about depression and how to tell the signs theyd just hold a small vigil no one would go to and id be forgotten as quick as the crash was 
1,amstarting to have suicidal thoughts ive always told myself that i wouldnt succumb to my emotions especially after my brother took his own life a couple of years back my thoughts on the topic of suicide have gradually grown over timeim sustaining myself with a job ive worked for 3 years now and i amcurrently enrolled in college ive had to see every single one of my friends go on to do better things while i sit here doing the same old shit and have the feeling thati am not making progress i lost the best girl i ever had in my life because i let my anxiety get the best of me and ruin the relationshipi tend to talk to myself and sort issues out and i try to tell myself that its all temporary but i amstarting to lose faith i found myself today planning it all out in my head while i was at work i dont know if id actually go through with it but i actually thought of how and when and should i write a notei dont know whats wrong with me and it might just be a phase but its getting worse
1,i want to die but i ama coward i have been suicidal since the age of 6 but never went through with it why because i am a fucking coward i dont have the balls to do anything including killing myself the only reason that i have lived this long is becausei ama fucking pussy well ive found a way to get past all that when i get extraordinarily high in combining whatever the fuck i have on me that fear disappears all i want to do is die and i amready to do it all i have to do is pop those pills drink a ton while tripping and i amgood to pull the fucking trigger itll be quick i wont feel a damn thingi ama failure as a human being and i dont belong in the gene pool the sooner i kill myself the sooner itll all be over and nothing will matter at all by thenwhat is the fucking point of living like this
1,i feel likei amlosing my friend and idk what to do so my friend has recently lost friendship with his best friend it looked complicated and she was very in love with him they stopped being friends for unrelated reasons he is very depressed and doesnt take his depression seriously or believes he is i feel like hes pushing everything back and acting tough so he does not get help for him self and hes had a suicidal history ever since losing his friend his personality is nonexistent now he was down and depressed looking before they met but i thought it was his regular personality after he met her he would actually smile occasionally and be in a completely different mood so it finally clicked and i realized he shouldnt be that way now hes way worse than beforei amafraid hes not taking care of himself hes closed off so idk how to go about asking him without making things worse idk any close friends of his who i can tell idk what to do and i amafraid time is ticking any suggestions
1,november maybe two days ago i decided that if the upcoming month really went as horrible as i feel it will id be gone by november its the sweetspot between various deadlines i have no control over and more specifically the monthi amliable to be homeless homeless or shoved back in with my stepfathers horrible parents and i choose the former in place of returning at the heels of hags that threw us away like they did all their sons said i was on track to becoming a whore called my brother and mother both wastes of space i will be positively if i go back to that fear of just walking to the bathroom of literally living in the attic and being sideeyed for breathing ive only told three people what they did to us so if anything getting it out is cathartic catharsis however does nothing to help what extends past emotion though i wish someone would hold me for just a moment i literally cannot exist dont have the papers dont have the papers to get the papers things wouldnt improve if i just packed myself across the country and stayed with friends that only half know me nor would they really improve if i had the money to fill my college seat fee that one was a real eye opener spending years clinging to the notion that college would save me no matter the debt or trials only to have what hope that proffered stripped i swore i would it work but here i am drowning in unmarked unexpected territory such is lifemy parents would separate if it werent for the fact that we are dirtpoor and completely reliant on my now jobless stepfather my maternal family is somewhat excommunicated and theyre hardly any better off than we are theyre rotting in their town just as we are in this wasteland my mother and i joke bitterly that weve got some multigenerational curse maybe thats just the curse of poverty and abuse cycles speaking of the day we found out may come our way my parents got smashed as per usual and fought fifth or so time now within the past year that my stepfather has stormed off in the night twice that we know he attempted to leave us and later shove in our faces how easy it was three days in and they havent said a word to one another hes gone all day supposedly at his parents place but we have suspicions that align with missing chunks of money no one seems to understand the gravity of my situation though my interaction is increasingly limited after a long period phoneless internetless and barely eating we moved across the country when this all started we used to move pretty frequently but its been three years i was homeschooled during that time and never allowed to leave our apartment no single thing can be remedied without tracing back to the roots of others hence why ive only ever turned in full bearing to reddit with it having at least a grain more anonymity while unfurling my life story than turning to acquaintances of course it lets me still keep that whole gdforsaken cordial distance with them what few positive interactions i have since i dont want to burden them with this they may get bits and pieces becausei am not one to lie but i cant tell them this its too much they shouldnt have to even shoulder that burden brieflyi amdone very done ive got my cat and my little brother but my friends are busy and havent seen me in years if at all and my mother iscomplicated she poured out all of her disappointments in me recently my religion my school despite having an offer and a huge scholarship thanks to years plastering myself to good grades my existencei feel so losti am not allowed outside havent been since moving here a few years ago and cant even afford myself a breath of fresh air i dont see the point anymore things will be getting better because legally theres nothing for me to do theres nothing i can take into my own hands no simple mentality changei amthoroughly fucked at the most crucial point in my life and i feel hollow alone frightened i pray november isnt it

1,cant live with or without her we had a falling out because of drama and nowi am not going back to her because of various reasons it hurts a lot to talk to her but after 2 years of friendship i dont think i can stand being without her anyway she is a bit toxic but i was going through a really bad time when she came to my life when i was alone almost all the time and she was the first person i actually spoke to in a while i dont know how to put the past 2 yrs of friendship in words because she really means a lot to me even though she was a pain to talk to at the same timei ampretty conflicted because i feel like i would do better if i cut her out of my life but at the same time i feel like i lost something really important that i will never get back again and it feels like it because in comparison to her everyone else seems awful they dont even want to try to be similar to her at 20 i have been seriously considering suicide because everything seems really awful and painful without her in my life i wont get her back so whats the pointi always think about how the scenario could have been different but it just makes it worse

1,end of my rope i lost my dream job in 2009 i havent been the same since ever since then things have been going downhill my wife and i stopped being intimate we basically existed and somehow continue to exist as roommates she makes more money than i do now and she takes care of 90 of the household expenses the small amount of money i do bring in goes towards my debts i have been unable to get past the job list 8 years ago i dont know why but i just cannot do it adding to that my health has gotten worse since then i refuse to go to the doctor and refuse to go to the dentist i just cant bring myself to do it instead i drink myself into a stupor nearly every night and ignore the pain in my mouth and in my chest i am now at the point where if i dont get over my reluctance to take care of myself i wont be able to get a meaningful job or make anything out of myself problem is i am so terrified of learning that something horrible is going on that i cant see past that it occupies my every thought my wife is an incredible woman she accepts my faults most of them and is incredibly patient i am failing her i have failed her in the past and if i am around for more years i will continue to fail her and fail myself i can no longer accept this i just turned 40 i dont want to turn 41 on my 40th birthday spending time with my parents and wife i looked out over the city and decided that tuesday was the day that i needed to let them all move on now it is friday and i dont feel any different family have gone home wife has a bright future i feel like i am just a roadblock to prosperity i remember when i was 19 and i was convinced that i would die before i was 21 i lived a hard life and made some bad choices back then in fact i should have died a number of times somehow i survived and prospered then things went off the rails again i guess this is what happens and at the end of the day i think tuesday was always the logical conclusion 
1,tomorrow i wrote a letter to my family in which i mentioned thati amtransgender and bisexual googled a bunch of suicide related things such as how long does it take to bleed out all i have to do now is to inform my online friends that i will disappear and might not come online ever again hopefully they wont be asking too many questions i dont want to make them panic i just want to disappear i am afraid to be honesti am not afraid of dying but instead of what would happen if i were to survive it somehow its all or nothing tomorrow on september 23rd i will hopefully finally die 
1,i always just use reddit to stall i need to just delete this stupid throwaway and finish the job before i convince myself to suffer another few months until i end up back here again its always the same

1,freshers week at university is killing me absolutely killing me for those who dont know freshers week is the first week or two weeks at university here in the uk lots of parties and events take place during the week or weeks and lots of people end up meeting each other or forming relationships i wish i could say that i either hate or love it but i cant give a solid answer on the one hand meeting lots of new people and going to clubs and getting drunk for the first time in my life feels good and takes away most of my sorrows and defensiveness but on the other hand things get much much worse when i realise what is really going on in those events and how much of a failure i amthere are lots of issues that i have so far but one of the main ones is you guessed it virginity and girls many websites and newspapers claim that one of the big things that will happen during freshers week is the romance or getting with someone whether its a simple dance making out or actually bringing them back for a one night stand many students have done something with either the opposite or the same sex sometimes both during this week or weeks and thats one of the main causes of awkward situations when you meet that someone you did it withi hate it i hate being a virgin even as young as 18 i hate seeing all these girls and boys whether they are already in a relationship or just met making out with each other or even kissing once or twice i hate having to make things awkward when i talk to girls or things not going further than just a short conversation though i fully respect consent and if they simply dont want to go any further i hate having to constantly be on the defensive in case they have a boyfriend or guy with them who will attack anyone who so much as talks to them in a wrong way i hate having to end up losing my friends to the crowd in the centre of the club which i learned the hard way i dont survive in i hate so much more of what goes on therebut i cant leave iti cant leave it because i know i will achieve nothing of the sorts should i try and seek out ways other than going to a nightclubi am not looking for a girlfriend at the moment its freshers week for fucks sake youre not meant to be forming relationships already because they wont last and please dont emphasise on this point its trivial every single night every single minute of me being in there not being able to do what the other guys who got girls are doing is torture its the worst i have ever felt in my five years of wanting to get a girl possibly the worst in my life me being suicidal at 11 was nothing compared to what i am and will be going through at the moment i am at a complete loss its the end of the first of two weeks of freshers and i still havent made any progress ive got drunk three times out of the five times i went out and still no drunken making out or hooking up though i know there are other ways to get with girls every time i ask someone for help they are on repeat here are a few examples of what they say and what i really really want to replyyou dont need to rush things b neither did the guys making out with the girlsi am not rushing things because i want toi amrushing things because i have to because if i dont do so by the end of freshers things will get a lot harder as i will have to balance lectures and activities with trying to get with a girl life is more than just losing your virginitymaking out with a girl i know that and just so people know i know its not going to fuck with my studies in any way i wont let it people have said that so many fucking times its not helping either offer some real advise or dont the same can be said of a lot of things yet people still worry about themthere are lots of people who are still virginsdidnt make out with a girl still not helping its the same as saying to a depressed person lots of people suffer from depression at some point in their lives its a subtle way of saying get over it which in itself is really not a helpful thing to sayyoull end up with a lot of embarrassmentawkward situations no hell to the no the same people saying to those who got drunk and embarrassed themselves its alright b they wont even remember it when lectures start have the audacity to say this to me there is nothing embarrassing or awkward about being able to say i lost my virginity during freshers week and it was great or i made out with her so hard last night if anything it will instil confidence nobody fucking understands nobody like drones all they do is just repeat the same fucking useless advicei am at my wits end with this it runs through my mind every fucking minute of the dayi am not trying to set up a multinational company become a multi millionaire or anything that i know will take time and effort alli am looking to do is make out with a girl like all the other guys seem to effortlessly do and end up taking one back to my place to fuck is that so much to fucking ask for 
1,i know i deserve it whenever i mess up i like to punish myself other than the obvious like cutting sometimes i dont eat for hours even thoughi amhungry my record is 22 hours but i eventually caved because i almost fainted sometimes i force myself to walk home alone in the cold and rain because i dont deserve warmth or human company when theres a voice saying that i deserve punishment for being a terrible person on repeat any timei amsuffering it makes the pain a lot easier to bearmaybe one of these days that voice telling me i dont deserve to live will become loud enough that i will actually have the balls to end it all

1,amabout to run out of reasons to keep going this week i just made a list of things that used to make me fell good and now prevent myself from ending my life and i figured out that now i only have 1 motive to wake up in the morning and it isnt enough i feel desperately lonely since 2012 when i moved into a new city and couldnt manage to make new friends only the few ones that work with me and even though they disappear as soon as i move to a new job the only connection with my old life friends and family was my exboyfriend but our relationship was a mess i dont even know if i really love him like ever but we went along for 5 years after my last birthday in march i just realized that he no long filled the emptiness in my heart and he doesnt even treated me like anybody was supposed to be treated by a loved one then we broke upnow i have no family and no friends my mom is the only one and we like hate each other playing videogames watching movies or trying to pull myself into social situations doesnt seems to have any effect to relief the pain anymorei tried talking to my ex again but he doesnt want to talk to me anymore after the breakup he was the only one able to keep the suicidal thoughts outta of my mind and he used to have some kind of mental i willness too so we used to help each other now hes fine with his job his new friends his family that loves and supports him and i am no longer any relief to him i aint even a good memory as he wants to erase me from his life at all costs but he got his almost perfect life and i got nothing but nostalgic sadnessi feel empty and alone
1,my cat died today my best friend hey people so as it says in title i was fighting with depression for a few years now and i actually felt likei amtotally okay last few months but today my cat died my best friend she would always wait by the door when i was about to arrive from work she was always next to me when i was home and now its all so empty i have trouble forming bonds but the bond i formed with her was strong i dont know how to keep on going the worst thing is that i could be blamed for her death i took her to vet because she lost weight and she had some parasites that actually started a cancer in her body vet said that maybe she could have helped her if id brought her earlier she always used to loose weight when she was in heat so i tought thats why she lost some weight but i was wrong and now she is dead they had to put her to sleep forever i cant stop thinking about how it would go if i took here to vet earlier i only noticed she is getting worse a month ago so sincei amliving alone at 21 and paying for living and school while working i had to put some money together before going to vets place i cant stop blaming myself and missing my little tina i always have this feeling that she is here i look on my bed and see her and a second later i realize its just my imagination she is gone i love her so much but i failed her i really do hope she is at better place now waiting for me like she always used to when i was comming from work
1,i think i m almost there i m really drunk my friends have finally passed out i have all the chemicals i ve planned to use idk i guess i really wanted to talk before i did it even if it s anonymous i m almost there just one moment of courage and i m gone 
1,anyone feel this way i dont have any reason to want die it is all just so pointless and none of it matters and we cant control ourselves anyone feel like life is pointless even though you arent going through anything rough
1,my 17f best friend 18m is depressed and suicidal and its draining me its going to be longi am sorry about that so a little background weve been friends for about 4 years with its ups and downs but in the end we still stick together he has had a lot of problems in his life living in a poor family sexual and verbal abuse from colleagues and death of his father to name the most important onesrecently his girlfriend broke up with him to be with another guy from his class obviously he now hates that guy hes had undocumented but pretty much obvious depression and suicidal thoughts before that but i think this has been a breaking point for himafter the breakup hes been telling me a lot more than usual about how he feels saying that hes never going to find anybody who will love him romantically that hes given up on talking to new people because everyone who he meets ends up breaking his heart in some way that he feels alone and basically lacks reason to live plus is overdrien with hatred for that guyno matter how many times i try telling him that its not true that he has people me and some other friends who care about him he doesnt listen to me and just keeps talking about all of this there has even been instances where he would outwardly tell me his plans on killing himself and i had to talk him out of it he would also mention the guy that stole his girlfriend a lot talk about how much he hates him describe how he wants to attackkill him even mention that hes had a dream where he shots him with pleasure they go to the same schoolclass so he even stopped attending it because he says he cant stand looking at him and seeing how happy he isnow the reasoni amwriting all of this is because ive tried helping him a lot of times but theres only so much that i can do i told him that he should see a therapist but he doesnt want to i try telling him that its going to be okay and that i will stay with him but he doesnt believe it hes questioned me a few times thinking that i dont actually care about him but i am still working on proving him otherwise and i think its slowly succeeding but i will be honest and say that its really draining me the way he talks about all of his problems and i cant even help him in any way every single time he starts talking about this i feel guilty for not being able to do anything usefuli amstarting to question this friendship because i love and care about him a lot not in a romantic way but the amount of sadness that i get from knowing how he feels just makes me want to stop talking to him sometimesi realize its probably selfish of me to say this but really talking to him when hes like this has been very tiring i feel like i cant do anything to help him anyway after all ive tried so i just end up reading about how he gives himself max 5 years of life because he says that after that he probably wont have the strenght to live anymore and how he puts on a mask and pretends to be happy it feels like its too much for me but maybei amjust the wrong one because hes clearly sick and in a worse situation than me so i wanted to know am i wrong for being tired of it should i still be friends with him if it brings me so much pain i cant just leave him now because he would get even more depressed and suicidal so what should i dohe truly believes that theres no way he could ever feel better or find someone that will love him he refuses to see a therapist because after his fathers death he doesnt want to give his mother any more reasons to worry i dont know what to do anymore thank you for any help by the way i am not a native english speaker so id like to apologize if the text is chaotic or if there are any grammatical errorstldr my best friend is depressed and suicidal doesnt want to get help i love him but its physically and mentally draining me and i dont know what should i do
1,is this normal heythese days ive been feeling down at school i barely talk with friends also since we are in different classes i laugh at jokes but as soon as i am alone i start to think of how i get hurt example when i stand at the bus stop i imagine how i would jump infront of a car and get hit there is something holding me back and i am probably too scared to do it anyway in the last hours i started to push myself to do impulses things like throwing my phone i am signed up to do workout but i am not feeling like it i lied to my parents that i went to the gym even though i didnt and now they dont talk to me and say what an asshole i am granted i am rude to my parents sometimes and now they keep talking what an unthankful asshole i am these things might be right but it brings me to another point i get angry pretty quickly lately its not that i have some uncontrolled aggression disorder idk the point is i imagine myself being hit and being in a comaunconscious but am too scared to be permanently dead ive been thinking about going to a psychiatrist but maybe this is something everyone goes through sorry if this is all ordered its just that i dont know anymore activities like programming or gamings arent enjoyable anymore to me
1,growing up i didnt realise growing up meant dying inside but hey its whatever
1,no will left to livei am not sure whyi amposting here in the first place perhaps it feels somehow cathartic to let my feelings into the internet without much consequence instead of try to explain them to those close to me and fail to do soi am so tired not myfeethurtfromallthatwalkingandineedtositdownandhavehotcocoa tired but sofuckingoverwhelmedwithallthethingsineedtokeepupwith sofedupwithallmyfailures tired worked my ass off all my life and still failed at life so monumentally with the wrong choices that its almost comical graduated with a subpar gpa living in a hellhole of a country where i feel likei amdrowning cant find a decent grad school with my profile cant find a proper job abroad i spend hours on end studying and applying arrogantly ignoring the fact thati amsimply not good enough i am just a massive failurehow have i come to this was that bright young girl only an i willusion how did i get so left behind how did everything go so wrongits my birthday this sunday forces me to take a good hard look at all that time that ive wasted and at this point there doesnt seem to be much to undo the damage i wish i had the courage to kill myself tried many times got pretty close on a couple occasions but obviously never close enoughi am not sure i could now either and thats the absolute worst its impossible to drag yourself out of bed in the morning when you know nothing you do that day is going to make a difference youre still going to be the same loser you were the day beforetimes passing by and each minute is yet another reminder of the life that i wasted i feel unfathomable shame and guilt for not trying harder but i have no more will to keep on cant keep up this freaking charade anymorei dont think anyone will miss me afteri amgone mom will be glad to have one fewer persons whining to listen to dad wont give it much thought and my brother might not even notice thati amgone boyfriend will likely be relieved to have gotten rid of the burden that is mewhy couldnt one just disappear why does one have to try and deal with a live shes not equipped to deal with why does she need to have the scars left to remind her of that

1,need friend i need to keep my mind occupied
1,about ready to throw it ini ama young adult 22 and the thought of living on my own with no help of any kind is driving me towards suicidei have no friends either as they all left or made there social circle smaller leaving me out
1,am going to die by the end of weekend and the thing that hurts the most is that there is nothing i can do about it not when ive tried every trick in the book to stay alive i really wish it didnt have to be this way and now i get to prepare my final 2 days on earth
1,i feel so lost please help i really could use a friend i usually am on here different username and would rather not share helping others to get back from the brink tonight i am feeling really low to the point of suicidal i am overwhelmed by a number of different factors and each one would make me seem like an ingrate i am not i really dont want to die i dont want to give into these feelingsthey scare me i really dont think i would actually do anything to hurt myself but the feelings are there on occasion tonight has been bad i am worried about my cat that is sick potential flea infestation on top of it all which makes me feel like a horrible pet owner and i love my two cats to death not literally dont worry i am also very worried about my husband who i got sick because i was sick seasonal cold i am still trying to recover myself i know that probably has made it harder to get out of this negative thought process i tend to get myself into sometimes late at night when i cant sleep i havent slept at all tonight i have been obsessing on things that are out of my control at the moment and it sucks like i said i wont hurt myself i am just having a very bad night even so i am posting here as a reality check to myself i really need someone to talk to i dont have a new therapist yet i have a great husband who really helps me a lot and works very hard and i just feel like i am a lazy burden who is keeping him from having the life he really wants but he says thats not true i wish things could be easier i am sorry for rambling i just had to get this out somewhere 
1,again i want to die again it s always again i don t care i don t want to get better i want to curl up in a ball and die nothing traumatic has occurred and i have friends and family that would probably support me through this but they don t know how i feel because i don t want them to support someone that doesn t want to change i have allowed the depression to become comfortable because it stays unlike my fleeting states of random happiness the thought of suicide crosses my mind more than it probably should but those thoughts have become comfortable too i think i ll eventually do it one day maybe not soon but i think i ll do it recently i ve come to the conclusion that i should die painfully because my life is great and i shouldn t be in this much mental discomfort so i ll die painfully as a last way of letting myself know that i am worthless and i deserve to be in pain for not seeking help or being able to fully take advantage of my life 
1,goodnight everyone ive decided tonight is the night i diei am going to take a bunch of pills a slit my wrists as backup i will let you guys know if it doesnt work out thanks for everyones support 
1,i want to use suicide as a means of getting my father to listen now heres the contextmy father was cheating with my mother by talking with a lot of girls on messenger aunt found out told my mother i dug deeper and found some other things as well happened 2 months ago parents still have huge fights everyday now back then i loved my father hes a very hard worker working from 10 am up to 12 am with no breaks and he still found time to spend with us on weekends but after we found out he changed bad he began being cold ruthless i already blamed myself for all those fights since i was the one who introduced my father to messenger but he threw even more shit at me started shouting at me everything i did was wrong restricted me from the internet and going out with friends i have to hide my phone every night for fear that he will take itbefore the fights i was depressed but nowi amdepressed to the point of contemplating suicide i cant bear this anymore he wont listen when i plead he wont listen when i scream he wont listen when i reason maybe suicide is the only way to show him the effects he has produced on me
1,today is the day while i realise most of my problems are temporary the pain i go through daily is not i really cant handle it anymore life just isnt worth it for me

1,i feel so empty right now both my gf and i have always suffered with mental health issues and weve always been there for each other for the past year weve been together recently however she decided to go to a therapeutic school for what could be either just a few months or even a year and as a result our communication has severely lessened she said she was getting sick of her mental i willnesses getting in the way of her life for so long and wants to do her best now to manage them so that when she is out she would be a lot more stable and healthy and that would make our relationship even betteri havent talked to her in a week and it wont be awhile before i do as she has to work her way up to earn more privileges such as leaving the school or using the phone and such and its been really hard without her i know how unhealthy it is to be so dependent on another but yet its so hard to change and i know i should be happy that she is doing what she can to better her life for her and everyone around her and i am happy for her and i amexcited to see how she will be as time passes but i cant help but feel so empty without hershe was my motivation for everything id get up in the morning so i could say good morning and talk with her before she goes to schoolwork now i wake up at 4 pm after being asleep for over 10 hours etc etc i dont feel like writing more examplesi realize how petty this isi ammad thati amlike this but theres no energy to change it ive been on the verge of crying for days now but i just dont want to cry because i know once i start crying it wont stop ive just felt and done nothing for so long of my life to have her enter my life changed everything and now that shes gone for awhile i dont know what to do its been so long since ive been alone that i dont know what to do with myself i dont have a purpose for myself i dont really know what to ask of people here i just needed somewhere to ventedit ive realized that i probably shouldve posted this in as i didnt really mention suicide at all here sorry about that i do feel suicidal but i dont think id do it because i know how horrible it would be for my gf to be away for awhile trying to get help and hear that i killed myself while she was gonei amsure she would even blame herself for it and i wouldnt want that

1,i think this is it i just finished my note to my husbandim scared to die but i see no other solution i am pathetic and my life is a mess i feel ashamed for being me i have noone except husband and he would be so much better without me i cant get help noone can help me and i can no longer help myself for 20 years i have hanged in there hoping for life to be better and yes some days life felt livable but this last year my life has come crumbeling down on me and the only solution is to end it it would be so muchbetter for my husband in the long run my depth will die with me my pathetic beeing will be gone all my life i heard how strong i am but i am not i am fucking weak i have nothing even my parents could not live for me so why should i yes both my parents commited suicide so did my uncle three other friends and my best friend and then i brought all this problems on myself by being a useless piece of shiti am so sick now i cant work or anything i hardly ever sleep or eat my life is hopeless and i bring nothing good to the table just being alive is not enoughi wish i could live but i cant i see no light in the tunnel i feel shameful for bringing myself to all this depth and now when i cant work everything comes tumbeling down on me i hate myself i hate to feel this way i am not strong i am weak as hell 
1,so i kinda went to look at guns today soi amprobably going to be fired next week because my work has been garbage this is just the cherry on top of a lot of garbage making me think continuing to deal with depression and severe anxiety like i have been for the past five years and my entire life basically nowi ambusting my ass to try and make sure i dont lose the job but i kinda hate it anyways and this is the second time this has happened where i am really close to being fired i guess i kinda came out of it while at the army navy store but goddamn like i was at that point like you read where suicidal folks get happy thinking they are finally at that point where its gonna end i guess part of it was deciding i didnt have enough experience with guns and needed to research it more or practice with one before i know itll be lethal like its still a very real possibility of happening me buying one my state has no waiting period and i have enough money at the moment to buy onei am not sure what i thought id get out of posting this i guess i needed to venti am trying to schedule an appointment with my therapist for tomorrow or monday but fucking hell 
1,i did a mistake ok so today at work a few co workers brought up suicide and joked about it a bit and i was in but then i started to casually explain the best ways to kill oneself and how i would do iti am21 and i have a very detailed plan for killing myself wheni am30 and life doesnt change to the better and one of them said seems like you thought about that a lot and i didnt know what to say and just went silent everyone looked at me in a weird way and i awkwardly tried to change the topicpretty scared that theyll tell this to our boss or other coworkersany of you ever had a slip up like that
1,it would not matter if i died 10 months ago i had some good times indeed but the times when i was at peace were very rare and i think i would not be missing out on anything had i died the thought of unconsciousness and void is still alluring it actually made me welcoming of death and not scared of it i already have an idea how to end it though had quite some time to think about that i dont want this its that simple
1,i thinki amdone i basically mauled my academic career in about 3 days and dont have the energy to put that or myself back together ive fallen apart so many times already and dying just sounds nice tbh
1,everything i do leads to suicide delete
1,i dont know what to say really i guess i just want to get this off my chest and see if someone can give me a reason to go on this post might sound like bullshit or exaggerated but its all true i dont think theres any way i could prove this stuff thoughi was born with aspergers ocd and depression ive wanted to die for one reason or another every day of my life as far back as i can remember i almost attempted suicide when i was sixmy family hates me both of my sisters would routinely bully me to the point of me wanting to die when i used to live at home my mom and dad like to treat my problems as a joke and laugh at me for being retarded or too much of a little bitch to get laid i would be physically abused chocked beaten head slammed into a wall and had my problems laughed at i remember being so sick i could barely stand and being told to stop ruining their nature walk i was also molested by a neighbor i told my parents they either didnt believe me or didnt care and hes been over to our house many times for holidays events or dinners ever sincethe only thing i ever really enjoyed was video games but my mom refused to even consider letting me have any even if i bought them with my own money no less she said i needed to spend all my time studying so i could get scholarships to college and i was ten when this started congrats to me i got a bunch of scholarships to a college i didnt want to go to and now spend my days in college year five so busy i barely have time to do anything besides study and its all for a degree for a job that i hate so much i would rather die than have to do every dayi have almost no friends and the few i do are usually too busy to ever talk to me i usually talk to them once a week at besti have no money no social life no romantic interesti am an asexual sex disgusts me and so does romance barely any friends and a family that hates me i can look forward to a life of working a job i dont want to work until i get old enough to retire retiring to an empty house with no friends or family and then slowly watching myself get old and then die with no one around who loves or even cares about me 
1,had my first thought today i havent been diagnosed but i amprobably depressed my emotions mostly feel like trying to see through waxpaper but lately ive been seesawing very badly i whiplashed today and almost quit my gym workout i got a wave of self consciousness and defeatism before i left my house pissed off at my appearance not being what i want it to be and having no control or recourse not obesity or anything but just genetic traits i get angry i cant achieve the appearance i want without a ton of effort i cant imagine how it is for women to feel something like that daily i will certainly never downplay their self consciousness ever i think i have a narcissistic streak that kicks in as a defense mechanism from accepting thati ama total failure piece of trash i know that i am not but facts dont matter when feelings are involved as soon as i got out of the shower after work i looked at myself trudged through my routine and felt totally drowned in hopelessnessthen i felt physically nauseous weak and had a suicidal thought on a treadmill i have no idea what happened but i finished my workout and i seem to be ok now i had a couple friends from years ago show up as they do regularly so i sort of had to snap out of it for some reason i wanted to explore the idea i visualized doing it with a gun in my room i wont go into the details not just because the rules say not to but i wasnt really interested in the effect on me for some reason my mind was immediately picturing my parents hearing a loud bang and feeling their gut drop through the floor at the suspicion of what i did then rushing over to finally see it it was less a taunt for me to do it but something my mind wouldnt let me get away with without going all the way it was a morbid curiosity that spawned from an intense wave of raw self loathing its so odd because i was generally 30 minutes before this happenedi think i just cant accept that i wont be what i see in my mind i dont get the attention i feel i deserve i ignored and i dont know what to do my life feels incomplete i dont know how to get to stage 2i amsurviving but i am not living and dont feel in control enough to adequately improve my life but i should be in controli am an adulti ama who is trying to be in the top 10 i look in the mirror and see 2 people depending on my mood balance i see a somewhat handsome man ready to take on the world and other times a man who is deluded afraid and hiding and the world by not giving me any attention is feeding the latter self image

1,why i have depression and what it makes me feel likei am26 years old i will be 27 in october ive suffered with depression for most of my teenage years and all the way up to now i will have it for the rest of my life its not something that can be cured only managed with a daily dose of medication that some days doesnt feel like it works i was bullied all throughout secondary school from roughly the ages of 12 to 16 it was an unpleasant time in my life there were a few people i hung around with and spoke to but i still felt like i had no friends within school my best friend went to a different school he was the only real friend i had outside of it i saw him nearly every day but i still felt like an outsider within my group of friends and even my own family i felt alone during school i was called names slammed into lockers tackled to the floor and pinned down i even had a brick thrown at my head once by one of my oldest friends the sad part is even though i was angry and hurt by what happened i couldnt bring myself to walk away from them because i didnt want to be alone i wasnt very smart i did poorly in my gcses after leaving school i took an ict course in college because i had aspirations to become a video game developer but i dropped out after a month because i knew it would take more than an active imagination to become a developer it would take brains and i was severely lacking in that departmentso after dropping out i ended up living at home jobless playing my xbox all day and doing very little else id borrow money that i had no intention of paying back off my parents and grandparents i feel guilty about that honestly i was always quite lazy i never really wanted to work but a part of that came from lack of confidence and rejection because i was bullied in school i had very little confidence in myself i was always doubting myselfi am not smarti am not goodlooking i will never amount to anything and i didnt like being rejected it made me feel worthless especially when i went to interviews and they said you dont have much experience do you my reaction was always how am i supposed to get experience if no one will hire me no one seemed to understand that i had a few small jobs that lasted a few days each but i always ended up being a jobless bum then one day my grandad got me a job with him growing christmas trees best job i ever had i loved it i worked there for maybe two years i enjoyed the work the money was great but it was only a temp job and i knew that going inone day my grandad asked me to drive the tractor up and down the yard whilst our boss was on holiday so i could get used to it he wanted me to reverse it back up the yard i did and almost crashed into the shed he lost his temper and yelled at me basically called me useless i felt so low that i sat in the truck for the rest of day and cried he was right i am useless in november 2015 i met my exfiancee amy she was my first girlfriend because i never had the confidence to approach a girl and ask her out i was a virgin until i was 24 i felt so special when amy agreed to go out with me i felt even more special when she said yes to marrying me two months later life was great for a long time then in march 2016 my job growing christmas trees came to an end and i was so scared that i wouldnt find another luckily amy helped me and i had a cleaning job within the week life was great againand then something happened i finally admitted that i had depression and thats when things went wrong i started taking antidepressants but i foolishly stopped taking them because i felt like i was getting better and thats when i started treating amy poorly i was nasty to her i hit her eventually i lost my cleaning job and life went extremely downhill from that point onwards i became more nasty and cruel i was snapping at her more often i hit her more often she didnt know who shed get next jekyll or hyde jekyll was the man she fell in love with sweet kind caring loving the man who helped her get out of debt that her exboyfriend left her in a week after we met the man who bought her an xbox one as her first christmas present the man who treat her like the princess she was hyde was the man she scared of cruel physically abusive nasty a man who didnt realise what he was doing until it was too late who didnt care about the damage he was causing in short he was an asshole but that wasnt the real me the real me was the man who would hold her as she cried herself to sleep who would sit on the sofa crying after trying to follow her when her mum upset her only to be told to leave her alone who made her laugh at his stupid jokes who would help her with money whenever she needed it in short he was the man she fell for two months ago she left because shed had enough of the abuse and i cant really blame her for thati am angry at myself for letting it get this far and for being such a stubborn idiot i never meant to hurt her i never meant to cause her so much painnowi amalone againi amjobless again because i quit and i am in so much pain myself becausei ammy own worst enemy all i ever wanted was to get married have a family i can be proud of and have a job i like so i can provide for them i wanted a son who grows up to be a better man than his father and a daughter who grows up to be exactly like her mother i have friends and family who say they care about me but i am not entirely convinced they do if they did my three best friends would have invited me to visit new york next year if they did my family would invite me around for a meal one night the little things maybe i dont want them to care so it would be easier for me to do what i feel i have to do in order to make this pain go away ive tried to commit suicide three times in the past two months i tried to overdose three times and failed each time ive cut myself too during those times i tried to kill myself i was acting irrationally because she refused to talk to me after a month of no contact she decided to contact me out of the blue and brought all these old feelings back then she decided to ignore me making me feel a hundred times worse because now i knew that she had been with other people since our breakup and she was out with her friends whilst i was crying in my room so i was trying to kill myself because i was upset over being ignored and being let down by her but now i feel that if i do commit suicide itll be spontaneous therell be no plan itll just happen i can already feel something or someone pushing me towards the edge i know howi am going to do it but it wont be me doing it i wont be in control and maybe thats exactly how i want it to be i love my family i love my friends i love amy i dont want to die i want to live theres so much i want to do i want to play the next splinter cell and watch john wick 3 but not when i feel likei am in hell i feel numb lost adrift in an ocean of despair and loneliness a man so broken by the events of his life that hell never be whole again and i want so desperately to make us both whole again but as much as i dont want to admit it i believe that ship has sailed and its never coming back depression kills everything your mind body soul heart family friends love and hope its the hardest thing to endure because only you can endure it people can try to help you through it but they cant share the weight by carrying your burden with you only you can and thats what makes you feel alone because youre the only person who understands exactly what it is youre going through its hard to listen to people telling you to stay strong when you have no reason to stay strong its those people who make you feel weak its those people taking your hope away from you by the things they say or do my own mother and sister have called me selfish for wasting everyones time when theyre trying to help me it pisses me off that my mum has called me selfish when she suffers from depression too and has wanted to do it herself but the only reason she hasnt is because of me and my sister in all fairness thats a perfectly good fucking reason to not do it if i had kids i wouldnt do it because i have a responsibility to them but because i have no kids no job no partner ive got not responsibilities so why shouldnt i be allowed to end iti saw someone say on another reddit page that its only selfish in the sense that i want something for myself and that its the type of selfishness that someone should be allowed to have which to me is completely spot on whats truly selfish is wanting someone to live in misery and permanent suffering just so you dont feel sad or upset over their passing it takes true courage to make that jump knowing full well that youll never go to the cinema again eat your favourite food again or make love again the only thing that stops us from doing it is the knowledge of the void well be leaving behind but unfortunately it will get to a stage where we cant quite comprehend that thats the danger of mental i willness it blinds us to the world around us in our heads were totally alone which means theres no one to hurt ive come to understands that life is a series of events that leads us down a path of darkness with occasional beams of light i willuminating the way forward its not the destination that matters its how you get there and who you get there with unfortunately the person i wanted to get there with is no longer around
1,it got so much better and nowi am in hell again i dont even know how to begin about nine months ago i first posted here i was in hell like ive been for most of my life then at the beginning of the year i decided to risk it all i told my best friend i always loved him we got together i felt like he gave me a purpose and made me felt alive he showed me the path to get out of hell i couldnt believe it in fact i lost it all after a couple months he broke up with me out of the blue via message and blocked me i have been on meds ever since part of me wants to destroy him or what he has become as hes not who i knew but rather a stranger part of me wants to destroy myself because i thought it could get better i could be happy its all gone in the blink of an eye i just have no reason to be here life is not fair i am so tired of fighting and for what i gave him everything and all i got as a thank you was to be treated worse than shit everything ive done with him was the bright side in my life i have never been happier now everything just lost meaning i feel like a robot living becausei amsupposed to not killing myself because of the pain i would cause to my family sometimes i wish my life was really my own and that i could just end it

1,ive spent the last 6 years living a lie and i just want to end it all hey my name is beau and ive never posted on here before but i dont think i can keep all my pain i anymore i feel like i should start much earlier than 6 years ago so here i gowhen i was 3 years old i was diagnosed with a brain tumour i spent 2 years in and out of hospital i didnt even know what was happening all i knew was that my parents were letting these scary people in white jackets take me away and put me to sleep i would scream and scream at my parents while the doctors dragged me away i think this is where i first felt that i couldnt trust people and that i was completely alone i got better after that and went to a nice school it seemed like everything was fine i made some great friends i still know very well today and i seemed to be adjusting well even though i joined school late then i turned 8 and everything fell apart again i got another brain tumour and this time i was older and wiser and so was more fearful than the time before i knew what was happening and i didnt want to die i wont go on about it again but obviously i survived but it left me with some complication my pituitary gland had been damaged by chemotherapy and so i couldnt go through pubity unless i had the help of synthesized growth hormones which i had to inject into my stomach every night for about 8 years they worked pretty well though i would never have grown an inch and id still be the height i was at 10 years old but i am59 which is fine with me there was one problem though i felt that my head was quite a bit out of proportion with the rest of my body because the growth hormones i was given were only experimental i was bullied a lot at school for looking weird and it hurt my confidence quite a bit but i never spoke to anyone about it then i went to college and got to re invent myself and it was great for about a year that then you realise you cant really change what you look like and even though everyone liked me i still got bullied by a few people but the thing that really bothered me was that none of the girls i liked wanted to go out with me well i know that obviously not everyone is going to fall head over heels for you but it actually feels a lot worse than being bullied because the people who are rejected you arent bad people theyre good people they dont bully you for how you look but they understand the bullying and thus dont find you attractive for the same reasons the bullies bully younow lets get to the title ive spent the last 6 years living with a girl that ive been in love with for about 5 of those years weve had an incredibly strange relationship we were never going out we never had sex we never kissed its wasnt romantic for her but we did spend all day sometimes lying in bed hugging and kissing each other anywhere but the lips i was extremely confused because i told her i liked her but she said she didnt want to ruin our friendship weve spent almodt every day together for the last 6 yearsi am not a person anymore ive lost my identity fast forward to now shes decided she doesnt want to live with me anymore so she can go out with another guy one that she wants to be with hes taller stronger and hotter than me you can read the jealousy in my writing but she is my world and weve been together for so long that to me she was my other half nowi amalonei amhaving to move back to my parent and i actually just want to kill myself the saddest thing is she doesnt even seem to miss me which lowers my self esteem two fold i think the main reasoni amsad and she isnt is that i know that the time i spent with her even though she didnt love and never wanted to be intimate with me was still the best i could ever expect for myself i will be alone now for the rest of my life but she is beautiful and so will be fine she find the things i gave her and more from her new boyfriend i dont know what to do should i just kill myself if the best time of my life is over now i need some advice from people who wont sugar coat it

1,i really have tried i just dont have the energy or hope anymore i grew up for eight years with a mother who has bpd for those of you who dont know what that is it is a incredibly abusive and toxic personality disorder my father allowed this for years until she attempted suicide underneath my bed on one thanksgiving and was removed from my homefollowing this i grew up with maids and nannys because my father was often at work one of them was abusive towards me for serval years but never left marks on my body my father never believed me so when cps came over as they did multiple times nothing was ever donei was sent to a boarding school for two years when i was a teenager by my ex stepmother whom my father married after knowing her for a week on eharmony really fucked up place one of the staff members that managed me actually gave birth to a child under her dorm room deck and left it there to die google jesscia bradford jya no one noticed until it started it stinkas an adult it look me awhile to get used to being a person again if that makes sense i took some lsd went to some amazing music festivals i stopped drawing as often and became an aerialist it was extremely cathartic doing it professionally across the country helped me see and experience a lotstarting last year i cried about it a bit then got over myself and became a stripper gigs alone were good money but werent enough to keep me moving forward in life while in a stable place also my father had quit working at that point because of his depression my family was living off of food donations at home i knew i needed to do something for my future that was fast money the job itself can be pretty depressing sometimes hilarious but overall excellent money i worked hard for a year i bought a car payed off all previous medical debts furnished my apartmentthings were finally starting to look up for me i was finally starting to get stable and then start saving to go back to college then i found out my family had lost health coverage because my father quit paying the bill six months ago i was once again swamped with medical debts that were not my fault also may i add i found this out after i had loaned him money for his car payments that month he knew what my job was this timei injured myself while training last month i have no health insurance to get treatment i cannot walk around to go make money to afford the treatment or get another job i have 1000 saved and that will only get me an mri my county indigent will not take me i make too much per month i cannot find a sliding scale clinic in my county who does orthopedicsi am 24 years old now i have tried and fucking tried my best i thinki amready to go i just got my dl two years ago i have nine credit hours in college and my father spent my inheritancei am tired of men touching me who dont give a fuck about mei amtried of feeling alone with no one to turn to for helpi amsick of feeling trapped if i have to live in a country where people are so selfish for resources that we dont even have tax paid universities and tax paid doctors i dont think i want to exist in it anymore if letting twenty different men a night suck my tits is the fastest and most efficent way to pay for these things rather than being stuck in debt for years with no place to live in the meantime its the kind of tired that sleep wont fix

1,my confession at the beginning of my seventh semester already riddled with the feeling of guilt for having my parents spend much money on my education i took it upon myself to do whatever i can to recover it i refrained from going out with friends eating out and i never went on trips with them i started working online earned enough to sustain myself and save a little for the future an opportunity to save more arose when a internship opened up at a company upon consulting with my seniors i learnt it was no good a company to work for even so i joined for the monetary benefits that it provided i would be paid a stipend and also the dormitory fees for the final semester would be returned little did i know what i was signing up toon my first day of joining i immediately regretted my decision the place was far off and the people even more so i travelled in public transport many a time standing most of the journey which took more than an hour and a half each way with what little money i had left after all that was spent on travel i bought gifts for my family with all this travelling came the physical strain and a chronic back ache i put up with all this for more than five months hoping that if i could make it six months that would suffice and i would then work on getting abroad little did i know that the hard part was yet to comelittle did i know that my very own parents for whom i sacrificed so much would make me feel pain more than i even experienced before i always thought i could take pain i was right i could there are two types of pain the physical and the mental no one realises that the latter is much worse i have sacrificed so much for them and now when i need them the most they turn on me treat me like a criminal for i am not working not brining income not putting money on the table i have taken time out to write gre ielts gate and to learn german language i know there isnt enough time yet i am misunderstood and taunted and harassed for not working for not making money i have no place at what i used to call my home i am criticized for where i sit and for using my laptop and the wires that surround it i am criticized for the way i sleep a man needs two things in life to know he does not belong there the lack of a place to live and the lack of respect i have neither here i have contemplated ceasing to exist but decided against it for the people that know me and for my dreammy own mother who i have come to despise for her constant taunting and chiding and her narcissistic nature has no love for me her anger issues and irritable nature has changed me deepy and fundamentally i have come to realise they value money more than anything else for the past few months depression has been lurking above my head like a dark cloud and now i feel it has finally taken me over i feel numb devoid of all love and feeling i have come to a point where i am beginning to wonder why should i go on

1,this is what human weakness looks like depression has been eating me alive for over 20 years everything was great until highschool and i dont really know what happened ive been going through the motions for a while have a home paid off wife and kids but even still it seems likei amonly still here for everyone but myself if life were an amusement park ride it needed maintenance when it was my turn not looking for sympathy not looking for encouragement i simply need to know if anyone has any ideas to start enjoying things again as of now i wake up go to work watch my kids speak to my wife use the computer go to bed i sleep most of the weekend away or piddle with some pointless task i didnt start drinking until i was in my 30s and now thats pretty much the only solace that remainsi think about suicide about 10 times a day when i first wake up to go to work when i bring my kids to daycare when i sit down at my desk when i look at the clock and it isnt moving when i think about my life and my legacy pretty much anything real or lastingive failed at everything i set out to do in life and pretty much have just been going with the flow since my dream was to be a computer game designer whilei am not stupid or incapable of learning i simply lack any semblance of organization or follow through used to tell myself that it was probably for the best and id be going down a new and exciting path i never meant to take but its not the casei held out hope for years as the most cliched piece of support i typically receive advises now the old body is starting to fall apart and my ticker is giving outi amout of hope and i really dont like the idea of a slow descent into medical debt undoing everything i worked so hard for my whole life by buying a few extra years seems for lack of a better word insaneim still very concerned for my families well being so i am considering a very painful accidental death in the near future the policy has been active some time and hopefully ive been nondescript enough i guessi amonly here for one reason not to ive pretty much checked out mentally so any arguement for the kids is moot ive written them extensive almost book length messages they will receive upon my death and i feel it adequately sums up who i was and what i think they need to knowthe only time i can speak like this is behind the mask of a vpn while browsing private not a soul other than my wife knows about my depression and shes not strong enough to lean on anymore i dont have family or friends and my coworkers arent exactly the best people to talk to wheni amon the edgethanks for taking the time to read and hopefully you never find yourself going down the same path if youre wondering yes i have thought about how this will affect my children i will kindly refer you to what i said earlier about living only for others its gotten to the pointi amvery tired of it id like at least one act in this life to be what i want by my own hand

1,i think i should kill myself tonight ive been trying so hard for 8 years now to start feeling better and nothing is working the last remaining things that make me feel something are fading quickly i spend all day in the void theres no way out i cant carry on like this
1,i dont know guys i feel likei am not going to do anything about it today but what about tomorrow often i feel likei am doing okay and i amsurviving but then seemingly out of nowhere i get these for lack of a better word episodes in which i get absolutely crazy its like there are black tendrils clenching on my brain all the thoughts i thought had left cascade back into my present and then even my memory betrays me i feel fine now but i just dont know what will happen if i have another bad one
1,posted this on rdepression but i genuinely plotted out killing myself tonight i thinki am going to do iti amfucking done i cant go on anymorei ama fucking disappointment and i am too ignorant to do any of my fucking homework or anything that could inconvenience me in any way i feel bad for my fucking parents they seem to care for me so much and i amjust an asshole to them they support me in everything i do and i just yell at them and spend their money i lost all my friends at school none of them ever talk to me anymore i just bury myself in my room and play fucking video games and i just get so fucking bored sometimes but i just keep playing them because i know theres nothing else id rather be fucking doing all of a suddeni am really fucking socially awkward and cant get a fucking girlfriend or any new friends it seems i used to be fine talking to people and now i cant even hold a steady conversation with anyone i just dont know what to say after a really short period of time i dont know i could just be going through a really big mood swing but i genuinely feel like it would be better for me not to feel anything than to have to go to my stupid fucking school tomorrow and sit through my stupid fucking classes with teachers i hate and work that makes me want to burn the place to the groundmy thoughts on the it will get better are pretty narrow minded i feel like thats some automated message that people just say in order to add some sort of reassurance to posts like this because it will just get worse the more i alienate myself the less my friends will be inclined to hang out with me not to mention that my grades are dropping and i cant push myself to try in school so not only will nothing get better it will only get worse because i will be forced to work in some shitty fucking job that i hate getting paid less than adequate for living just because i was too lazy to fucking do my work like everyone else and theres nothing i will be able to do about it at that point
1,just dont know anymore maybe if i wasnt born with social anxiety maybe if i had more friends growing up maybe if i could get minimum wage job maybe if i had a car maybe if i could find one girlfriend maybe if i could be away from all the people and all the noise for as long as i needed maybe if i had just one of these things i wouldnt be thinking like this maybe it wont last much longer i just dont know anymore i have no more answers

1,i have a gun and ammo but no balls i just wish i could do it i wish i could just pull the trigger and end it all but i am too damn scared i live every moment of my life in pain i donr want to be alive but still i cant do it
1,i turned 24 a few days ago and i already feel like a failure i feel like i am too late and feel like i have no chance to survive in life i feel like giving up everyday edit i know that everyone else has difficulties and maybe this kind of hardship feels too close to home to some but please try not to just post this is so like me becuase it is not helping at alla few days ago i turned 24 but i was not excited to celebrate my birthday in fact i was horrified and even embarassedthis started to happen when i was around age 2223 but i was already feeling like i was too late in life like i was too late to have my shot to be able to have a good future in my lifei know that everyone goes through tough situations in their lives and everyone makes mistakes and have to go through obstaclesbasically shit happens to everyone a lot and most of them come unexpectedbut i felt like this ever since i was a teenager even though the world is very vast and has lots of things going on with lots of things happeneing at once it is very impatient and wants things to be done there are so many things going on and to catch up with everything is a nightmare and the world is changing incredibly and it is a lot of pressure on the competitive nature of the capitalistic world we live ini really wished that i had a grip in my life much earlier but i was a kid before i was an idiot with no clear goal and well shit happened bullies abuse and so much more and in the end it scarred me and it scarred me for so many years that only now i wanted to take charge and actually do something about it but every day i keep blaming myself for allowing these things to happen to me that i allowed myself to be such a weakling and make myself into a shadow of my own self and be a pussy instead of actualyl grabbing my own nuts like other people do and keep going and move onbut i was pushed back in a way and i felt stuck for many yearsi did manage to eventually try to push myself to keep going back on track but half of my attention is always concerning that i started to get a grip on my own life too late so i feel that i am mostly battling against my own guilt and shame and embarassed that i am too late and should already just give up everyday i keep making comparisons with everyone and often see everyone better than me better grades better income better lives better possible futures more happiness more confidence and so much more i feel like i am stuck in both my past and my future afraid of both sides and afraid and confused on what to do stuck because i feel like i have a lot of baggage about my past self and looking deep into myself to look into my own shattered soul is a fucking nightmare and a job that will take forever and incredibly painfulon the other hand i am afraid of the future i keep making countless and countless possible calculations and preparations for the worst like what if this guy is better than me should i study harder what if i will not pass this test should i apply for a job alreadyits extremely infuriating and scary especially when you own soul feels broken and your mind against you and criticizing your every move its trying to push yourself while trying to fix yourself at the same time while trying to battle against countless waves of enemies like the demons of the entire hell are after youhonestly i am 24 and i am still at university doing my bachelor degree there are those days where i feel very embarrassed that i havent graduated yet while people younger than me already did and i know that i have made many mistakes in my life and the shame and the guilt is very strong and very deep everyday but the worst part is that i have a poor habit of ruminating about those mistakes and unable to forgive myself or tackle it to make sure that i have the right strategy to tackle it if i ever happen to make that mistake again or avoid doing itmost of the time when i make a mistake i go into a dark spiral of shame and guilt and sheer selfcriticism and i end up in a cycle of criticism and doing those mistakes again and feel even worse in the processsometimes i even ruminate about my ruminating habit as well which makes the burden and guilt much worse and this habit has been happening for years and affected how i look at myself and affected how i work and how i think during my studies how can i break this habit what strategies i can use to help myself from going deeper into the cycle of depression anxiety and extreme selfhatred and selfloathing and suicidal thoughtshow can i really and truly stop being afraid of the future and stop criticising myself for pretty much anything because i feel like i am at the bottom of the food chain and i feel like i have no chance to survive in lifehonestly i often feel that i should just grab a gun and shoot myself and save all the trouble from trying to push myself when it will be all for nothing and avoid all the humiliation and embarassed many people have already managed to achieve a lot in life and i feel that i was left behind and i feel that maybe i should just give up i cannot risk experiencing further humiliation than i already have 
1,everything seems like it should be great but i amlost utterly confused and i dont even know whyi amposting thisi ammarried with a 3 yearold we both work and i feel completely alone not a close friend in the world and i amjust so tired been slaving away in kitchens for the last ten years i have a good education i just never got my degree cooked to pay the bills etc found a great gal got married had a kid got another on the way love my daughter shes the best but i swear to god everyday i wake up and go to sleep with the realization that no one is on my side surei amgood at my job and the pay isnt terrible but my boss treats me like a turd i get home and tell the wife and she doesnt want to hear it just wants to know that the checks are still coming along with the dental and healthcarestarting to think she should just marry the companyim just a warm bodymachine to the people around me but this body is sick and tired of putting up with all this shit it isnt enough that i gave up on my hopes and dreams its not enough that i have no escape route that doesnt fuck my family over its not enough that i work until my whole body hurts the next day and i barely have the energy to walk the dogs much less be an activecaring parent but as a mani amrequired to bottle it all up inside and pretend everything is great just for the benefit of those around meim losing it i am exhausted constantly and frankly i work with a few great people but lots of them are total idiotsi amgreat at what i do but its taken as a matter of course financial stuff is almost all fucked and were always barely scraping by i just want to give up none of this is what i hoped it would be and i amfed up with giving 100 everyday to everyone and getting nothing back but complaintsi am angry as hell but i have zero outlet no one is safe to talk to and i cant trust anyone tried talking to my wife and she just cried and swore and cant be supportiveshes just worried about money and our family thats correct of course but the fact that my wellbeing doesnt even come second placethat hurts id really like to cleanly quickly end it all i thought i had something valuable to bring to the world when i was growing up but i see now thati amjust a brokendown cog in a really fucked up machine kitchens are lonely places even though youre in everyones personal space all day i dont need a reason to keep going i have plenty but the parts are wearing down and getting it to turn over when i hit the ignition gets harder and harder everyday i just want to lash out at something in righteous rage but the targets are just shadows 
1,probably not the most fitting sub but in trying to get out of a rut anything would help starter note i will likely not kill myself i have strong ties to a dear friend who died and it was the worst experience of my life i would never wish this feeling upon anyone his 21st birthday is soon so death thoughts of course appear amidst the despairbut recently i was at a friends party and i just couldnt deal with being there i spent the entire time sitting in a corner alone i was just too worried about too much other shit that was going on for me to enjoy it but for some reason as i looked out the window with t balloon weights next to me for some reason i kept having thoughts of grabbing the rock smashing the glass and then ramming a large shard into my throat as a note i used to be a very violent person til this friends death i bit many people during primary school it was not pleasanti was mostly scared of myself for thinking these things i just hate being by myself because i keep thinking this sort of thing and panicking i recently kicked my window in a panic with the intention to break it but i held myself back enough to cover my leg with a duna so i didnt injur myself just thought it was weird seeing as i still broke it
1,this is how i imagine myself this is how i imagine myself i imagine that ive stepped off the building thats lined in brick inch upon inch above the ground sky high a million feet i imagine my phone having numerous frantic missed calls but its turned off i imagine asi amfalling a remorse for anyone who ever really loved me and fleeting thoughts of hatred for the people who think they do but only love what they think is me i imagine regretting not writing anything before i go to tell them to shut the fuck up and hope that in an afterlife i can haunt their asses i imagine a splayed out kid in the parking lot not moving like a sack of meat still and plopped down on the pavement i imagine my black backpack torn with wear because i refuse to get another backpack until the onei amusing is in tatters abandoned up atop the mall carrying the government book that i was supposed to have read up to page twenty five in my pink composition notebook my three subject black spiral my lime green accordion folder my economics ook with a brown cover my calculator some pads money pencils two plastic bags all for thing i need to do later i imagine darkness and revel in infinite discontinuation i imagine nothing

1,i just dont know what to do with myself anymore 24 m this is going to be long and complexi am sorry and thank you in advance to anyone who reads it ive been severely depressed and have had severe anxietyadhd my whole life but it started to get really bad when i was 17 i am 24 now i never struggled in school gradeswise but i did every other way i have one sibling an older brother who is severely disabled his health was getting worse while i was in high school through college during this time i was also coming out of the closet as queer because of these things i was getting no attention from my family and i instead turned to drugs and drug communities i called my friends for support i got arrested for possession twice but my dad just paid a lawyer to take care of it and nothing came of the arrests all records disappeared the whole process going through that was traumatizing though as people like the police and probation officers were incredibly shaming and abusive so the situation was taken care of but absolutely nothing was done for me to recover from the trauma to figure out how i got into drugs in the first place or what i needed to get better my dad just told me to keep workinggoing to school and act like nothing happened so i did my brothers health took a turn for the worst after i graduated college and basically my parents are providing him 247 care for everything pretty much just making him comfortable until he dies this started like two and a half years ago doctors say it is impossible that he is still alive but somehow he is and we have no idea how long hell survive i didnt have a job after graduating so i moved home to figure things out being in that environment where my parents were busting their ass and unable to get much medical support because of insurance red tape and usas shitty health care system in general to provide every single need to my brother even feeding him and helping him go to the bathroom i was just existing in the shadows being ignored i tried to help out as much as i could but it was just so painful it just sucked me deeper into a even darker depression i started smoking marijuana and drinking liquor from the moment i woke up to the moment i went to sleep every single day i lost all control i contemplated suicide very seriously and told my parents they decided to send me back down to the town i went to college in its close to where my dad travels for work once a week so he got an apartment and just had me live there he told me to go to the career center at my alma mater and try to find a job all of my friends from college either moved away stopped keeping in touch or just got into fucked up situations like one of my friends moved in with an abusive boyfriend so i was pretty much just trapped here alone family only cared about me being okay enough to work i turned back to the only thing i knew which was substance abuse i got connected back with the same drug communities and was in full swing of it againi am still doing it to this day even though i am severely depressed somehow i am still highly functioning and skilled i was able to find a job and i make good money now it is an incredibly stressful job though which just fuels the substance abuse even more which puts me at risk of getting caught again and losing everything i see a great psychiatrist but he is just as stumped as i am i think what i really need is to be removed from my normal adult life and be in an environment where i can make my mental health my 1 priority and not have to worry about anything else i feel like a monster being jealous of my brother because i wish my parents had the ability to take care of me until i get myself back on me feet but i have an apartment lease a car lease and this job i dont want i dont have the means of creating or finding that kind of environment i need i spend all of my freetime drinkingsmoking myself though bad emotional episodes because i am so stressed and in over my head i cant go home becausei amafraid i will become more depressed againi honestly just have no idea what to do with myself the only solution my doctor has is meds and therapy which ive been trying on and off for years without any real luck all i can really think about is offing myself i just want nothing more than to just give up on everything i know everyone at my age feels lost but i feel lost alone and unimportant like i could disappear and everyone would continue on with their lives i am to the point now where i am okay with just being a sad tragedy people share on their facebook pages and then move on with their lives
1,i think time is running out i think ive failed on getting out of the hole that i found out ive been digging myself into years so much of the advice ive heard wont help me i dont really have the will or want to push through the next day let alone yeari amat the worst point ive ever been if someone tells me i need to be strong i have the urge to curl up and tell them that it doesnti ama weak little person and it doesnt seem like making out is possible or even very rewarding
1,why try i ve always been a pretty gifted kid as far as most aspects go i excelled in most classes aside from math from an early age was pretty articulate even as a toddler and used to genuinely enjoy learning before all of the enjoyment was sucked out of it by the pressure on me my mom s always held me to a standard of a s and b s only even a c is failing in her book and now i m not meeting it i ve got too much work and i get it done but i want to relax too i don t want to be doing something educational 247 because i m too burnt out by the time i get home i m trying to bring my grades up but i just can t do it and now my mom s cold as ice to me and is taking away basically everything that gives me any sort of relief from the constant stress she knows i ve got depression and anxiety both actually diagnosed and she knows how she treats me isn t helping at all but she just doesn t care she says it s all because she wants me to succeed but if feeling like my own mother hates me and that i ll never be good enough and having constant mental breakdowns and suicide attempts because of my failed attempts to meet her standards is what it takes to succeed then i don t want to why even bother if i ll fail anyways why even bother trying to live a life that makes me wish i were dead the only thing that s really kept me here for almost 16 years is the thought of my friends and family but i don t care anymore my friends can move on and my mom s just going to have to deal with losing her only daughter because of her refusal to listen i try so hard to get help but there s no use in talking if nobody will listen nobody aside from god himself could convince her to give me a chance considering my dad s already tried and so have i so i m not even going to bother anymore i ve already got a method planned and a note so i m all set to go i don t need to be alive anymore not with a life like this i don t want to graduate i don t want to go to college i don t want a job or a family or anything like that if going through hell is what it takes to get that then i never will i can t be alive anymore because this life isn t worth living and i m practically already dead just not physically i ve been attempting suicide since i was a fourth grader believe it or not but this time i m going to make sure that it s not an attempt i may not be able to succeed at anything else but i can and will succeed in dyingi know this sounds like typical teen angst bullshit but i don t care anymore my whole life i ve always been told that things get better but they never have the only way to make things better is to die i m tired of being the broken gifted kid i m tired of being alive
1,i don t know what to do i want to die so badly but i m too scared to end it which just makes me feel angrier about everything it feels like everything i do is stupid and meaningless even if i work hard and find success financially it feels like it would all be for nothing since nothing in life makes me feel any happier there is this burning in my brain that just won t go away and i always feel like i m being choked all i want is to go to sleep and not wake up the next day but i doubt that ll be happening anytime sorry if this is formatted weirdly i m on mobile

1,my friend from a long time ago tried to kill himself i had a best friend all my childhood but in our late teens we drifted apart he did drugs drank too much and was very pessimistic about life in fact that was true when we were friends as well but i was more tolerable to it then he has been posting extremely depressive things to facebook for the last year and a couple of months ago he told me he tried to kill himself it was a huge shock but i dont know what to do he says he has no friends left and that life is really tough at the moment also job and money wisethe thing is that and i dont know if this is selfish but i dont have the energy to hang out with him or the strength to help him i havent seen and barely talked to him in over five years he sees me as his only true friend in this world and i know that if i start to hang out with him he will be extremely clingy and desperate wanting to do things all the time when we did hang out it was pretty draining and back then he was way more stable than he is now i just dont have the energyi also know that saying this to him will probably push him over the edge i also cant ignore him because that also feels mean under the circumstanseswhat can i do

currently a 20 yo male so i will start writing from the beginning it all started back when i was a kid i had an imaginary friend whose name was fred fred was always there for me and he was a great friend for pretty much all my life he bid farewell when i was 17 needless to say i cried all that daymy first episode with depression was back when i was 14 i think i got expelled from my previous school and entered a new one i had a lot of behavioural isssues back then so i felt abandoned and like i had betrayed the friends i had not only that i aso felt i disappointed my mother this was the second time i was expelledbut fred tried to cheer me up he did his best so i wouldnt be sulky all day long and i even met a guy he was the first persona i talked to in that school and was really happy for the first time i thought everything would get better from thenhowever the next day i went to school i didnt find that guy anywhere needless to say i felt devastated had i done something wrong did i scare him somehow all those doubts were bugging me back then some years later i found him again i met other people and made new friends while looking for him and asked him why he had disappeared he told me he didnt like our classmates so he changed his classroom he felt terrible when i told him how i felt to this day he still feels bad for what he did but ive got no grudges against himso i was all alone during my first year at that school with the exception of that single kid i didnt get along with anyone else so that year i was friendless i used to help my arts teacher do some works during the breaks so i wouldnt be alone all day long i learnt the hard way the value of human interaction otherwise i would be reading in the hall ive done this since i was a kidone day i was unbearably sad so i didnt feel like eating anything also you had to go to the dining hall so you could have lunch and i skipped lunch for a whole week cause i didnt want to go alone in there and be seen as a weirdo i was an idiot i knowso i stopped eating for that week got some nasty hunger pangs and ate as much as i could when i got home i also ate a lot during the weekends so my mom became suspicious one day i was feeling really really hungry since waking up so i ate my snacks it eased the hunger pangs for a while but during spanish class that teacher really liked me i passed outi obviously dont remember everything i was sitting in my desk and lost consciousness next thing i remember everyone was standing by my side looking at me someone went for stretcher and they carried me to the schools nurseryi stayed there for a long while and when i got out another teacher that really liked mei am still indebted to her if youre reading this thank you greeted me she began asking me questions beating around the bush until she told me so you say youve been eating well but i can prove otherwise she showed me a list they used which they checked when you entered the dinig hall i didnt have a single checkshe said she wouldnt tell my parents i begged her not to if i went to eat everyday i agreed and to this day my parents dont know about that incidentfast forwarding to college lifei decided to study medicine and entered college when i was 17 everything was fine i still was sad cause of freds departure he left when i was 17 remember but i was really happy for the change of environmentuntil one day i was having lunch at the dining hall and saw a guy who i thought was cute but said hey its fine you can find other people attractive doesnt mean youre gay i was wrong i had a crush on that guy i still kind of have to this dayi was really confused back then so i experimented with a different guy who liked me i didnt reciprocate though it was a terrible idea not only i felt bad for him i was struggling with my sexuality and that triggered another depressive episodelast year i finally came out to myself as bisexual i decided i needed to move on the guy i like has a boyfriend and has been with him for 2 years i think so i decided to talk to him i got really nervous and didnt tell him how i felt but i think it was pretty obvious from my body language to this day i still kind of have feelings for him i know its ridiculous we havent even talked except for that time but i am not jealous of his boyfriend i hope they stay in love and have a healthy relationshipif youre still reading this thank you i really appreciate itand now to the present dayive been having suicidal thoughts for some time actually i even have it planned i study medicine so i know thats a warning signi havent done it cause i promised fred not to do it and he told me that if i kill myself he wouldnt talk nor come see me again i know i should go to a psychiatrist but i dont want anyone in my family to know about thisthanks for reading this i know its long but i needed to write all the important details any help is really appreciated please be safe and have a nice daynight

1,theres only one reason i havent killed myself yet and its not a very good one cw rape when i was 17 i was raped he was my boyfriend at the time hed done something asked if it was ok if he slept with someone else on his upcoming 18th birthday or something like that and it had disgusted me i didnt want to have sex with him that night but no was not an answer he liked to hear previously when id said no he just got me drunk but that night he just kept pushing and pushing until i gave in because i felt like i had toi had a history of being abused before that my family was not a good one he knew this he had also systematically isolated me from all of my friends he knew there was nobody else in my life and he knew that gave him power i cried the whole way through and even though he didnt finish because it really started feeling like i was raping you and i am not a rapist that didnt erase the previous fifteen or so minutes if i remember correctly he didnt stop for me he stopped for his own selfimageto this day he is the only person i have had sex with willingly or otherwise and thats the only reason i havent killed myself yet i dont want to die knowing he was the only person ever to have fucked me it feels like hes winning especially since its been over half a decade since it happened and ive still not been able to be with someone elsei feel like thats slowly becoming less and less of a concern though nobody would want me now anyway i have no life in me theres nothing about me that would attract another person i recently realised after spending several months without any of my friends contacting me that i could literally have already been rotting and nobody would have noticedi dont know why ive not done it maybei amscared of the pain of failure
1,amselfdestructive and volatile should i just do iti am not forcing anyone to see my past posts but id recommend the last few just to understand how selfdestroying and volatile i am its probably nothing compared to what some people become suicidal about but hey its thatnow ive had suicidal tendencies way before today i have depression and take meds and all that shit and they really work if i never actually think about my own situationand today i did and i ambeginning to regret not just ending it back when i first attempted suicide a few years ago the amount of pain i wouldve went through these last years is fucking tremendous my mother died my dad is paranoid i will do something my sister disappointed in me dropping out i ama fucking mess i just want to end it to be forgotten about to throw myself into a river of liquid space and disappear beneath the wavesif i did not exist my mother would be alivei amsure of it she was an alcoholic and died from a ruptured liver dad said she only started drinking when she had two children to look after of course not implying that i was the problembut i am growing up i was a shit to take care off aspergers and mood swings are all what i remember myself as a child considered bright to some regard but now i wish i could swap out my brightness with something more practical like charisma or something that would really help me socially now ive dropped out of high school going to a technical college for some diploma i only decided to work towards because it was practical and literally the only thing that would get me a job itim a selfpitimising shit and dont deserve the life assigned to me i want to connect with people but end up driving them away unintentionally i get angry passionate emotional but people dont like people like that they want some sugarcoated bullshit phonyass yes please no thank you person who sticks their finger in their ass and zips their mouth upim not importantim just not fucking importantif i disappeared not die just stopped existing nothing would change it wont be the next fucking big headline teen boy went missing all id get is a little fucking corner of some shitty fucking tabloid magazine if i was younger or a girl however you bet your fucking ass people would type that shit upbecause guys cant be emotional guys problems are nothing compared to girls we should just shut up and listen to people yap on and on and on and fucking on until they look at us expectantly waiting for our drytoned oldstyleradiostatictype voice replying near a whisper tell me moreand that person will smile knowing full well that you arent really listening but appreciative of the fact you would bend your own arse for them then yap yap yap yaptell me moreyap yap yap yapwow reallyyapevery god damn time i try to be open i try to say my thoughts on something someone always has to bring me down i get iti amthe yapper but why should i be so fucking subservient to people when they dont return the fucking favor fuck that i regret every minute i spend talking about something deep within me a desire tangled in cobwebs of barbed wire as i soon regret it its the same everywhere online offline its like ive already died and went to hell and have been spending the last seventeen fucking years just waiting for satan to pop out of nowhere shout you just been pranked and then having everything around me collapse like fake walls in a movie setfuck thisi am not waiting for anyone if it is going to endi am going to fucking do it whether it is today or in 100 years time even if i stop being depressed get married live a happy lifei amdying by my own handsi am not giving cancer diseases anything taking this one part of my life that will be under my control i was always like this i never had control over my mind one minutei am in complete control the next its like both arms have been cut from the shoulder and i am in the backseat of a car driving a hundred miles an hour toward an open active nuclear missile silo the only choice i have is to close my eyesfucki amjust so fucking done with me i want to be someone not me and hey guess what ive done this before destroying any reputation i gained and then throwing away the account and i amprobably going to do it again and again and again and again adn aigan and againi wanted to be a writer i wanted to be a games developer i wanted fucking anything that isnt me right now but ive realized thati amstuck here in limbo probably for centuries ive talked to councillors therapists the whole lot and they all say the same tell me more
1,the harder i try the further i fall i was diagnosed with chronic depression pretty early on i think around 12 or 13 diagnosed with bipolar when i was 19 and bpd when i was about 24 and ptsd about a year ago i am now about to be 29 in a few weeks and i have been stuck in the worst depression of my life since this past december i had been in a depression before that but i d come out of it within days i can t come out of it this time its been almost 10 months i don t have the desire or will to live anymore no i do not want to kill myself nor do i have a plan but it s like my brain has become hardwired to just constantly obsess about suicide it s almost like i welcome the darkness lately i haven t even been able to get into a manic state in probably a year this is detrimental to me i could paint and make the art i love to make when i am manic my artwork was my outlet and i ve lost that spark i actually felt happy and content i actually live my life and get shit done with my depression comes the most god awful anxiety i ve ever experienced it s crippling and it affects my home relationships and work life i ve tried multiple medications and they only make things worse i actually got started on a new one today basically the reason i am writing this is because today i have been in the worst place mentally than i think i ve ever been i lost it today i had to move in with my family last december after my breakup i was suppose to be getting money saved and bills paid off my depression kept me from doing that well now as of four weeks ago today my checks began to get garnished by a hospital here in town for thousands of dollars well today i get a summons for court because that same hospital is suing me again for another bill that is thousands of dollars more than the garnishment happening right now and about a week ago i get a letter from the irs stating i m being put on a levy or pay 500 immediately and then find out my car has an issue that needs addressed immediately before the axel breaks and that could cost around 600800 i ve been struggling living paycheck to paycheck so i had no savings and i literally got paid today and have less than 20 to last s me another two weeks i m trying like hell but the harder i get pummeled the more i want to give up i know i am strong and i know i am capable of shit i can t even imagine but i m reaching my breaking point my body is small it can only take so much the constant self hate and self destructive behaviors destroy me it s like i won t allow myself to be happy i feel like that happy feeling doesn t exist inside me anymore why are we so frowned upon when we want to end our pain and suffering i get that people will be hurt by it and miss us but staying is torture i can t even enjoy being around family and friends because i m so lost in my head my anxiety causes me to panic and then everyone thinks that i am upset i ruin people s good vibes when i bring my bad vibes around so we are expected to stay and be miserable and horribly pained just so they won t feel the sting from us going elsewhere isn t it selfish on both ends i don t want to exist in this world but i don t want to die suicide haunts my mind and we are becoming a little too comfortable with each other i am strong but i am tired 
1,feel like i need to have it as an optioni am not sure where i should post this since it deals with multiple things but i will just post it here because it could be triggering and it is related to suicide i keep obsessing over the thought of friends committing suicide whenever they feel low or seem off i get anxious now i get anxious when they are physically unwell as well because i dont want to lose them and that is the first thing my mind goes to when i hear they arent feeling great physically but i noticed the kind of anxiety is very different i think i have now finally figured out that that is because i feel like if they commit suicide then i cant anymore since i will be seen as an attention seeker thus i feel like i dont have the option anymore and i will feel nervous sometimes it even makes me feel like i have to commit right now because otherwise i wont be able to do so anymore it drives me insane that i keep obsessing over these thoughtsother peoples wellbeing because i feel selfish and i also dont want them to feel upset and by thinking about this and being unable to stop doing so i can literally ruin anything for myself i also feel anxious because i dont want them to be upset even if i know they wont commit suicide i will just want them to be happy and i also just really dont want to lose them i think the obsessing part is very much ocd related and the keeping it as an option part is depression related but i have no clue how to solve this regardlessi am not sure what i want with this post just get it off my chest i guess 
1,can you choose what happens to your body is there a way i can leave instructions of what i want to be done to my body when i kill myself or will it go automatically to my closest relativesi could also leave some cash to cover what i want donei want my ashes burnt and thrown into garbage dump or pig farm i would also want zero funeral or any similar eventthis would be in north america if that mattersthanks
1,i want to scream out on facebook that i dont want to live anymore but i have friends who have been suicidal and i dont want them to have flashbacks to their attempts one time one of them asked me if i was going to be safe i lied and said yes because i know she has anxiety later on that night i tried looking to see if there was a hatch leading to the top of the building my office is in there isnt but theres a way to open the door leading to a locked patio on the seventh floor of another buildingi feel so terribleeven now there are things that i want to say but i wont because i know that they might upset some of you the only person i can tell would be a therapistwho would then call the cops or the ambulancefuck if i ever do it theres a long trail of social media posts that will foreshadow what ive done

1,i cant do anything right quitting is the only optioni am20 years old and it seems like my life is just a constant cycle of trial and failure when i was young i was verbally and physically abused by the family and kids at school my mom died when i was 13 and my dad became a gambling addict the longest ive ever held a job was 8 months most other jobs i quit within a month or less most of the time by not showing up and not calling i had gotten fired from my favorite job for saying i wanted to kill myself to my manager that was 6 months ago nowi ama freshman at a local community college and its not going the way i wanted it to ive never been good with time management i did well in school up until 6th grade then i started failing classes my attendance was horrible and i got in trouble a lot which eventually led to me dropping out now it just feels like the same thing except now my mistakes are costing me money that i dont have i have a 3 page paper to write by tomorrow morning and i only have a quarter of a page written and i have to be at work in an hour i also have to do two pages of algebra homework and write a paragraph about a chapter in my education bookive never been in a relationship the closest ive ever been to one was a really close friendship i had with my boss at my last job a lot of the things she did and said confused the hell out of me and we ended up falling out and i am still devastated by it i can say with almost 100 certainty that i will never be happy no matter how hard i try life finds a way to push me to the ground and kick me wheni amdownit really seems like the only way out is suicidei amterrified of death but i cant go on living like this i wish i could just move and start over but life isnt a movie the only thing i really care about is music but i amnever going to go anywhere with that i really just want to die i honestly may just try to overdose on some pills before work i cant deal with it anymore
1,ive decidedi am going to commit suicide as a 1213 year old yerp hi guys its me the smart ass at least thats what my dadyouth pastor calls me ive made multiple posts here as but that account got banned so after much thinking ive decidedi am going to kill myself the reasons why should be in the link to my main account but the main reasons are my school and my parents steriotypical for a 12 yr old i know i literally have nothing to hold me up any support structure i did have my dad is taking away so i guess this is the end of the road yall my name was lathan armogida i used to love acting sports and my friends when i was 5 i said i would kill myself the day before i turned 13 i didnt really mean it i just didnt want to become a yucky teenager but yet here i am prepping for my 13th birthday on october 1st wanting to die it makes too much sense
1,i just want it all to fucking stop i cant fucking handle this anymorei am worthless and i deserve every day of pain that i experience
1,might be my lucky day todays my 22nd birthday never really put value onto special dates or occasions but it sucks to feel this forgotten got drunk as always to numb myself a bit its not even stress or self loathing what i feel atm just calm af and more than ready to put an end to it all 9th floor oughta do it first and hopefully last post on reddit idk if it is the correct sub but who cares my guts will be spread all over the sidewalk as well as my dignity in less than an hour anw read really interesting stories at this sub hoping yall either find the happiness you think you deserve or get drunk enough to find the courage to end it all i will be ready to go after deciding to call parents or nah
1,overdosed three months ago want to do it again now i overdosed a month ago on painkillers and ended up vomiting up half my stomach it hurt bad i vowed that i never would overdose again but i just feel terrible right now i have no motivation to do anything no nothing right now i feel really empty i have nothing to do and nothing i want to do i always thought id never be depressed id try to stay happyha ha what a joke my family doesnt even care no one cares 
1,ruined my life and his wishing to end it all i guess i will preface this with the fact that i am a 22 year old female i recently got alternatively certified to teach in tx without doing research on the school i accepted a job as a 4th grade teacher in a shit town in south texas called victoria the situation i was placed into was dismal at best everyone on the 4th grade team was new 2 of us first year teachers the other new to the district we were given very little guidance or instruction the job wore at me i couldnt sleep at night i woke up every hour with horrible anxiety 4 months previously i had met the man of my dreams he didnt have it all together but we fell in love fast and hard he had decided to take a job where hed be on the road traveling installing turf his job kept falling through little by little and he wanted to be with me in victoria one friday the overwhelming stress of the job got the best of me and i made the mistake of telling another teacher at the school that of i had a gun i would have already killed myself counselors and interventionist a stepped in and escorted me to a crisis center via cop car shortly there after my boyfriend decided to quit his turfing gig to come be with me thinking hed easily find work which wasnt the case he ended up doing day labor for 1012 an hour but depressed i still was i scored a job as a restaurant manager but through my depression i couldnt think clearly and the job seemed overwhelming and too much as well i ended up realizing i needed professional help and my parents are in a position to help so i called them and i left and went back to the dfw leaving my boyfriend in victoria tx almost broke with no job and no one to help him like i have he took a weed charge for me near san marcos and then got another ticket for driving with an invalid license so he has all this court stuff to go to in south tx and anyone he knows is in north tx i havent felt myself in a long time i feel incredible guilt and shame and resentment towards myself for my inability to keep it together i have suicidal thoughts daily ive lost 10 ppunds from not eating properly worst of all is just knowing that i have essentially ruined not only my own life but his life too when all he ever tried to do was help me and he believed me when i said that id be able to make it and that he should come down and be with me boy was i wrong the regret i feel for the struggle he will face is haunting he will most likely lose everything he has worked for his truck will be repossessed and none of this would have happened if it werent for me 
1,am so alone my friends constantly lie to me they dont want me around they just feel obligated to care because theyre nice people and thats even getting to the point where theyre constantly mad at me because i cant get better ive never had a friend who actually liked to be around me i cant be a burden on everyone anymore i dont want to feel this way i want it all gone i dont want sympathy i just want it over with already i cant live like thisi amscared to kill myself but i want to so bad 
1,wanting to die i am not sure if this makes sense but i want to die because i am constantly frustrated and nothing happens to fix the problems or issues at hand i am always working for hours and end and i try so hard to just do and be i is required of me but if i ever ask something or want something its unfulfilled and i am left high and dry time and time againi am tired of always trying to persist or keep going on i just dont want to live anymorei am angry at myself life and everyone around me
1,my birthday is going to be lame as usual family is coming out to see me either day before or weekend after but it seems more out of a sense of obligation than love idki amsad and not looking forward to it and on top of that i dont feel loved by anyone my only wish my only desire is to have a loving woman there on my birthday whom i can cuddle with and just feel loved for once in my wretched life life if you can even call it that has beaten me down so badly that i just sit at home and dont want to socialize with anyonei amdiabetic asd and crippling anxiety for the anxiety for example there is a woman who broke up with her boyfriend recently but i am too afraid to ask her out i dont know why i am typing this outi am tired and ready to just give up on everything whats left except death i cant stand being alone for so long its eating away at my sanity
1,amwriting my notes to my friends and family this one is for you the strangers who were so kind to me thank you this is goodbye internet i will miss youi amheading into the great dark soon enough i will try to tell you whats on that mysterious other side i will miss you strangers you were always here for me and you were my best friendsi am sorry for doing this to you as well please forgive me and stay strong find your happiness for me i did not mean for this to happen

1,nothing left to doi amdone let me preface this by sharing that ive struggled with depression or some form of since i was a child at eight i started thinking about suicide not seriously as i was young but old enough to know that it could potentially be a viable option i wont get into the years leading up to this precise moment because thats a very long story but i will say they werent good id reckon its a 5050 of life being an asshole and me being an asshole either way i can count on two hands the happy memories i have of my 25 years being alive i didnt start taking my mental health seriously until a few years ago prior to that i smoked over ate over drank and basically sat on my ass all day with my now ex who wasnt great for me nor i him i couldnt even handle a part time job as the stress was too much i bounced around university programs until i settled on an easy useless degree to appease my familyi amjust trying to paint a picture here so the current picture is thisi ama mental health professionals wet dream i decided i couldnt use my experiences in life as an excuse to be a lazy slob and decided to do something about it from then on ive quit smoking drink minimally eat healthy enough exercise a few times a week have built friendships started new hobbies went into a healthyer relationship see a counsellor am on medication that seems to work quite well for the most part obviously and i practice loving and appreciating myself i have a great relationship with my parent who is letting me house sit so i can pay off my student loans without worrying about rent i have a full time job that is basically data entry and make less than i should for someone with a degree but enough for someone living rent free overall i have a really great life that isnt very stressful and has given me many opportunities i should be appreciative of so why the fuck do i want to kill myself why cant i just be content with my boyfriend my job my life why do i want to cry all the time why do i get upset angry and stressed so easily why do i hate my life i feel guilt about everything i even retroactively remember things that werent bad and turn it into something to ruminate on i am so sick of my constant state of guilt remorse sadness and anxiety i feel like ive done everything i can and i think maybe some people just arent cut out for life i live in constant pain and fear and sadnessi am too tired tired of this roller coaster i know i will be happy again i know there are things to look forward to in life but i also knowi am going to hit the bottom at some point i am so sick of clawing my way back up only to be pushed down i just feel done i dont want to get up anymore 
1,before i go everyday its been everyday since i was 6 years old ive had at least one suicidal thought or action some days its only a quick idea and others take up my whole day i havent been diagnosed with anything yet and nothing traumatic has happened in my life i want to tell someone but i cant theres something in my head that i cant get outi amonly a teenager and i rely on my parents from everything i just dont want them to know because i know that they wouldnt care andor tell me that i need more jesus i fear confrontation because of this i cant tell anyone at my school the few people ive talked to said i should see professional help but i cant for the reasons i said earlieri am trying to push it deep down but for the past year its gotten worse and worse every day i try to have fun with my friends but for a while nowi am not having funi amjust playing video games and trying to sound a tiny bit normal laughing at jokes talking a little howeveri ambecoming tired of acting the same with my family i used to have fun with my siblings nowi amjust there i think my sister forgot what my voice sounded like because i havent talked to them in the longest time i think my parents are seeing that something is wrong they are helping a little my dad is often at work and my mom makes sure i eat and hugs me every so often but i no longer find comfort in those little things everything is dull now food tastes like nothing i hear people instead of listen i even think my color vision is being reduced i no longer can find happiness its only just life my friends joke around and say that i dont have emotions little did they know i no longer have a reason to live i used to care i used to try to get good grades i used to enjoy cooking i used to do a lot of things the key phrase is used to i no longer have motivation in life i dont want to be a quantum physicist my usedtobe dream job i dont want to eat i dont want to get out of bed i dont want to live anymore so i think when i wake up tomorrowi am going to barricade my door with my dresser and hang myself in my closet i just wanted to tell someone where and whyi am going ive only written a letter to my sister and texted my friend about it and my brother found one of my other suicide notes i dont think they quite know the full extent of it though i think at least someone will care on the interneti amno longer afraid 
1,the only thing holding me back is my family i dont think you guys understand this but for a lot of people suicide would have a huge impact on their family my mom told me that she didnt know if she would be able to go on living if i killed myself my dad said about the same thing and thats really the only reason i havent killed myself i dont want my peace to intrude on someone elses happy life both of my parents hate their jobs and are single and kind of lonely though they try not to be so i really feel likei ama quarter of all they have left in this world the other quarters are my siblings 
1,lies that need to stop around here it will get betteryou have so many people that care about youyou can do thiscall the suicide hotline theyll help youyou are importantkeep trying youll find a combination of medstherapy that worksall of these are bullshit and if you post this bullshit or send it to me you better be goddamn ready to back it upanyway i told myself septemberi amkeeping that promise
1,i cannot afford health insurance should i commit suicide i cannot afford rent healthy food and an acceptable standard of living like having a weekend because i have not been allowed a high income by those in charge i have hiv and several other preexisting conditions and absolutely hate my job with a passion what reason is there to live 
1,ive been passively planning my exit the last few years just need to do a brain dump now and get it out therei ama male in his 30s successful healthy people tell me they thinki am doing really well i think almost everyone would be surprised to hear i am thinking about suicide the last few years i have been planning my exit i dont know when exactly i will do it but probably before i turn 40my friends are all married and having children i am meanwhile trudging along trying to make new friends and stay involved in something outside of work i go to the gym a lot i read i have hobbies i travel i even moved across the country i can improve lots of things about my life i am a proud person and i am not helpless still i have no close friends that understand me and want to hear about what i am going through if i even hint at being depressed i get the old chin up tough guy or people just stop calling i also have very bad relationships with my family i have one sibling and we will probably never speak again not close with my parents i had one serious girlfriend but we broke up years ago and i have not tried a serious relationship since then lots of flings and short term dating but nothing serious and i dont think i could ever be in a relationship againi just cannot fathom a reason to keep living other than sheer momentum and the will to live i rarely experience any joy i just work either at my actual job or on hobbies and side projects i am constantly working the thing is i like working it gives me a purpose otherwise i feel like life is pointless i have to make something out of my life what else is there to do when you are my age dating is like torture to me everyone i meet on a dating site is just looking for someone to buy them dinner and drinks and show them a good time i feel objectified and i never feel a connection sex is meaningless sensory stimulation i enjoy it on a primal level but it leaves me feeling empty the only thing i can offer women is sex or the superficial stability that women in their 30s want basically to have a house and a car the trappings of a successful life but that isnt what i want i want to live a real life i want somebody who likes books and doesnt care about bullshit i have almost completely given up on women at this pointi am tired of getting burned and i dont want to date anyone i dont have a connection withmy sole hope in life is to somehow make that connection otherwise i think i am doomed to a life of working and striving for no reason for decades and decades until i am too old to work and i become useless i can keep plucking away at some of my goals for the rest of my life and maybe make some casual acquaintances friendly neighbors etc but am i so crazy to think this isnt good enough what is the point of becoming really smart and strong and talented and wealthy and amazing if there is no one else around and its just you in a room alonei dont want that to happen to me so i have started planning my exit i dont feel happy about this but it seems like the only way to have dignity in the rest of my life i dont want to be around for those decades alone it will be torture i am going to give myself another 56 years and make sure i have my ducks in a row so i can exit early if it seems like nothing is going to happenthe worst part is i cant tell anyone about this because i will be insulted and have them tell mei ambeing a selfish cunt or thati amjust being dark for even thinking about giving up my perfect life nobody understands i am completely alone in this world and it looks like i always will bethank you for letting me get that off my chest
1,my life changed in the exact way i wanted it to be and i amjust as depressed as before i have friends that care about me i go out and do things i drink i party i have sex theres a girl thats into mei amat a great college and i amjust as depressed as when i would sit alone in my room a friendless virgin wishing he had a lifei just want to feel happy i want to feel anything partying doesnt make me happy anymore i have no motivation to work on the things i should be passionate aboutim still not happy i still feel empty i want to drop out of school and wheni am in class i barely pay attentionwhats the point of living if i just feel garbage all the time anyway i enjoy nothingi ama fucking black hole
1,i am honestly unsure of how long i can continue hey guys first time posting here so if i am doing something wrong apologies in advance i am fed up i am 23 years old and i feel completely alone like i have friends all 2 of them and a family that i love but no matter what i feel alone i am 23 years old and i have 0 relationship experiance i havent even kissed a girl large part of this stems from me being overweight i have been working out for a year now and am down 30ish pounds but got a looong way to go i am currently overwhelmed with school as i am pursuing an msa and studying for the cpa exam at the same time all for a career i have 0 passion for i really like this girl at work like when i talk to her its simple all my fucked up thoughts and issues go away but we rarely see each other at work and this past summer i tried hanging out with her outside of it even as friends but despite seemingly wanting to go her boyfriend did not let her so i got ghosted we talk but the more i talk to her the more i like her which sucks because i know when i quit next year we will never talk again it sucks talking to this person that you know in a year they will not even remember you its all over the place i realize that and i am sorry but i just got to get this off my chest
1,i am so afraid of women that i should take my own life when i seal myself in my room to protect my socially anxious self from the judgements of my peers i hear the voices of my roommates girlfriends and i amparalyzed in fear and depression i get so upset that i cant see a way to escape the feeling besides killing myself i am a bad person and i dont think that anyone would want to relate with me i am terribly introverted and i have failed to live the life i thought i would live after 3 years of suicidal depression and social anxietymy roommates bought a knife set for the apartmenti amthinking about running one across my neck while they sleep
1,things reddit keeps deleting my posts because of misclicks i had a lot of things that make me suicidal but my mental frame is so broken that if i got a wrong reply on a post where i say those things i would have probably hurt myself the one thing i would have talked about no one replied or liked so whatever i yell into the void nowit is so late and i cant sleep because i want to kill myself yet again i wish i can go back in time and tell myself misery is better than loneliness so you better keep this friendship because you will not be able to have another friend again i wish i can stay home and watch tv all day and never worry about people no replying with just same
1,bummed after finding out sleeping pills are a bad idea ive just read a bunch of posts about sleeping pills pills in general being a really bad way to go the chances of causing death are almost nothing and i could end up with liver failure kinda happy but also annoyed at the same timei am too pussy to try a more lethal method guess that means that i want to live

1,came very close today i just needed somewhere to get this all out today i dont think it helps to keep everything bottled up so this seems like a safe place long story short and to be blunt i almost slit my wrists today i dont even know whati amcapable of anymore and its terrifying everything is slowly going to shit i cant afford a math access code for my college class right now soi amfailing homework assignments i got a 49 on my math test yesterday what kind of idiot gets that low of a grade on a college algebra testi amfucking pathetic i dont even try anymore i used to work hard and get straight as but now i wont even put forth a little effort this probably already screwed up my gpa and proved my stupidity enough to ensure that i cant get myself into medical school ive been depressed for the past 3 years of hs and college is just making it 20 times worse my family has no clue about my depression they never have i cant tell them i really cant my mom and brother both have bipolar and my mom is always telling me how glad she is that at least one of her children isnt struggling with such things and it would really bring her down ive always been the one to have their shit togetheri amalways the one smiling and making everyone laugh but right now i cant even put that mask on i just want everything to stop its so freaking overwhelming right now and i cant do it i cant do any of it id absolutely love to feel my life end and pick up a razor again but i cant because it will destroy my family i dont know i guessi amjust looking for someone to honestly tell me that it isnt the end of the world but right now i cant see how any of this will get better
1,theres a reasoni amstuck in my room without help because if i try to get help if i tell anyine howi amsitting here with a razor ready to kill myself and that i need help i will just get stuck locked up in a room for 3 days while nobody does anything to help me and then theyll charge me 2500 for the inconvenienceits fucking pathetic the hotline is useless ive called it before if youre not immediately in danger of killing yourself they end the call if you are theyre not interested in talking just asking me wherei amlocated and trying to call the cops on methere is no help
1,i have never wanted to kill myself more than in the past few weeksi am not the person to usually have suicidal thoughts although i am fucking depressed and a total wreck but the past couple of weeks are making me have the worst urgesim in college and ive been a fucking failure ive been studying longer than my peers it is getting better but recently i started failing exam after exam and it is breaking my spirit because i study for hours every day yet get little result and then when i say i failed they ask well whose fault is that its fucking mine do you need me to spell it outon top of that my parents fight like almost daily it isnt physical as much as it is mentally draining and abusive arguing fights every day then each complaining about other side to me and making me into a mental trashcan my only fall back used to be my grandmother but even she recently started putting problems on me because of my insane motheron top of that i am eating pounds of candy to artificially keep my mood somewhat sane and give me happiness for a short period as i study but i worry about getting fat again because i used to be obese i am also paranoid about getting diabetes because i am eating insane amount of sweetson top of that my parents wont leave me alone i just had a huge nervous breakdown when my father kept pushing me for the results of my exam that i dont have i tell him that i dont know that it could go either way fail or pass he pushes keeps accusing me of lying then i lie telling him how i failed and then he keeps pushing and asking more even when i tell him to please leave me alone if i would lock myself hed threaten to break down the door like he did beforeon top of that i have to get up early tomorrow to get ready for another exam after todays one but i cant because it doesnt matter that i got all nice and calm brushed my teeth and masturbated i had a massive nervous breakdown and now i struggle to go to sleep peacefullyon top of that i have no one to turn to and talk to after all this my mother is selfish and when i did choose to turn to her and talk she told me this whole thing is going to give her a heart attack self centered and trying to emotionally manipulate me into worrying tries to turn me even further against my father and showed desire to get away from mestop talking by forcibly ending the conversation when she was comfortable not meon top of that i cant go to kitchen to get sweets to calm my nerves because my father is there and i know he is a piece of shit that cant shut up and resolve some things later which will turn me into an even shittier moodi really want to kill myself right now i really do i wouldnt even have second thoughts about my parents like some of you because theyre pieces of shit and i dont care about ruining their lives but i wont i want to live and have the life i dream of and i know that it is possible i just wanted to pour my heart out to anyone who wants to readlisten because i want to not feel like a mental trashcan for a day thanks

1,who else feels like theyre only still living to spare the feelings of their family members theres nothing in my life worth living for anymore everything and everyone who brought any join into my life is gonei amdisabled in poor health i suffer abuse on a daily basis and i feel totally alone in this world it would be a relief to be able to just stop existing the only thing preventing me is the fact that i have 1 or 2 family members who i feel would be deeply affected if i were to check out on them so i suffer through each day more alone then the last in order to spare their feelings anyone else in a similar situation
1,i cant believe this is my life i cant suffer forever i will need to eventually do this i will need to eventually kill myself i still cant believe this is what my life has come to you only get 2 hands 2 feet 2 eyes 2 arms 1 life its not fair its unforgiving you get one life if something ruins it thats it youre life is over i never thought id be the girl who would ever have to kill herself now thati amat this point its just surreal i cant believe this is my life
1,if i killed myself on a monday my boyfriend wouldnt realize it until friday ive been having intense suicidal thoughts and imagining how people at work and how my friends and parents would react upon finding out i killed myself i spend a lot of time crying at work hoping no one will noticei am going insane quietly chanting i wish i was dead at times wheneveri amdriving or walking down the streeti amsecretly hoping someone will hit me but only hit me hard enough to kill me i dont want to be alive with a debilitating injury to make my life even worsei ameven imagining what i would do before finally pulling the plug ive been thinking about creating my perfect day go home to see my parents and my best friends that i rarely get to see since i moved away for my shitty dreamcrushing job go out to my favorite restaurants plan my last meals but if my friends are too busy with their successful lives to hang out i might just stay where i am go to red lobster by myself and get fattened up then kill myself before the calories can absorb into my body since i only see my boyfriend on the weekends and he rarely texts me at all i can kill myself on a monday that way i at least didnt work the whole week for nothing and he wouldnt even notice something wrong until friday wheni am not rolling up to his house maybe hed try to call me but there wouldnt be an answer
1,goodbye only 30 mins until i will be alone in my apartment and be free at last thanks for all of your help but it wasnt enough goodbye
1,less empathy for scary mental i willnesses ive noticed that the majority of sympathy towards those with mental i willness is almost always geared towards those with mild depression andor anxiety as opposed to those with chronic depression chronic suicidal thoughts treatmentresistant depression schizophrenia bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder whilei amby no means saying that depression and anxiety are laughing matters i am sick and tired of people with mild easilytreatable symptoms being treated as the standard as if they have any idea what the rest of us go throughtake selfharm for example if you have a few light cat scratches on your arm people will have much more empathy for you than the boy who breaks his bones or bangs his head on the wall or burns himself with cigarettes feel sad because you cant get a job have a little empathy hear voices see things that arent there always angry youre difficult youre a burden youre an emotional vampire youre an energetic drain youre a toxic person beyond helping feel a little bit anxious here have a bit of empathy cant leave the house because you feel like youre dying cant keep a job because social interactions makei am so sick and tired of people with situational depression who are magically cured almost fullyfunctioning members of society trying to tell people like me why we shouldnt die no one wants to be around someone who wants to kill themselves everyday no one likes it when youre clingy and have mood swings and have to be babysat everyday to make sure you dont off yourself i struggle from an eating disorder i make cuts in my skini amalways suicidal amglad you went to a mental hospital and realized that all your problems could be fixed by mine arent my problems rule my life and theyre something i will struggle with forever they color every part of my life there are much less resources for people like me and i will never be apart of the conversation on mental i willness because everyone would feel better if people like me didnt exist to begin withim a burden on everyone around me
1,what is mental health i dont mean that literally but it kind of plays into how i feel i feel like my mental health has completely deteriorated i think i suffered from clinical depression anxiety low selfesteem loneliness and avoidant personality since age 11 and until after high school i feel like this has left me horribly developmentally stunted i feel like my entire life has been one large distraction from life itself having spent nearly all of my free time playing videogames and watching television that did absolutely nothing to improve who i was in any way i think i only ever swam in my youth swam usa club teams for 7 years was because the endorphin release it provided was merely another means to escape feelings of anger boredom loneliness depression and inferiority i kept sacrificing so much of my time towards it because of the escape the only reason i gave a shit about my times or stoke technique was because it helped me feel superior to other people but dont mistake me here i didnt flaunt my in the grand scheme of things unimpressive swimming abilities in peoples faces i just quietly basked in the glory that came from being better at something than most people despite also not being very good in the world of people who took swimming seriously i never had any solid interests in anything important growing up i still dont really but being an adult forces you to semicare about the important things things that i not once ever seriously considered like who i am what my role in society is whati amgood at where i need to improve what the road to succeess looks like what path i should take in my life etc i always coasted along on this strange unjustifiable feeling that i was great and deserved great things in an almost narcissistic way i lived constantly in fantasy and daydreams of accomplishing whatever i wanted to at the time but never actually did anything to get there because from an incredibly young age probably starting in elementary school i always felt inferior and i never resolved these issues because i never felt comfortable talking to anyone like my parents about these internal struggles from the day i was born i never vocalized my feelings of inferiority which i think is partly because of shame but also not thinking anything of if why idk i blame it on myself for being a dumb kid who never learned how to communicate these things and still dont to this day because it would be plain inappropriate to share these things with a fellow adult who isnt a shrink that i cant afford i could talk to my parents but i have and let me assure they are far far from able to provide me any solace my mom is 52 and faces issues that fall in line with early dementia and has too many complicated emotional issues of her own to ever be able to help me my father is 61 suffered a stroke deeply effecting his ability to properly socialize and also suffers from depression and low selfesteem he actually went to the hospital for suicidal ideation this summer anywaysi am so tired i cany fucking finish this post and say all i wanna say but fuck i want to jump off the harry nice bridge so fucking bad the only word i can use to accurately describe myself is broken and as you can see that just barely scratches the surface id like to go into how becoming more aware of this brokenness in highschool lead to a weed habit that sabotaged pretty much every shot at success i had to this very day and how that just provided a nicer escape with the added bonus of but a semblance of a social life that i was and still am so desperate to have the ultimate escape just seems too appealing at this point 
1,goodbye message i wanted to say goodbye to all the people who were kind and good to mei want to thank my parents who even after my continuous disappointments talked to me and cheered mebut i dont think i can take it anymore goodbyei quit
1,when those suicidal thoughts hit some information about me i am 20 years old and i recently transferred to a new school i am a junior and i have social anxiety this past month has been hard i legit do not have friends i haven t made any and i dont see any on the horizon i come from a big family and i had a very large group of friends at my old school i legit go to class and then go back to my apartment because i just feel uncomfortable being out alone i live alone and the only thing i can think about is how easy it would be to just stop it feels like no one except maybe my mom would even notice i just feel so lonely and depressed and i just want to end it 
1,least painful method of deathi ampretty convinced that carbon monoxide is the best way to go legally anyway can any people whove attempted it this way give me any insight
1,i think i should kill myself i dont know what doi am in a terribly ambiguous situation okay so earlier in the year i posted a question on reddit about how i was planning on killing myself because i masturbated while my roommate was sleeping everyone was really nice and told me not to do it so i didnt and i deleted the question however when i deleted the question it still kept my responses to comments from people who commented on my original post and it kept the comments that i replied to weeks after i posted my suicidal question i posted another question about how i was struggling with my friends i had my phone screen facing up on a table when i was talking with my friends and when i got a response from someone it had the username of the commenter as a push notification on my phone it appeared on my screeni have ocd and i was worried that my friend saw the username looked up the user and looked up the users comments on my posti amalso worried that my friend saw my suicidal post and my response to what the commenters said and the commenters postswhy i am worried is because the stuff the commenters said said things like dont worry about it man i had sex with my girlfriend while my cousin was passed out on the next bed youre normal and ive done what you done before i still feel like a terrible person and a pervert but you were pushed by youre desire to procreatei amworried my friends know what i did or think i did something terrible and extremely perverted what should i doi amthinking i could kill myself to stop living in all this pain and mystery my friends have still occasionally talked to me this summer only about twice but i kinda dont want to be friends with them because theyre hypermasculine and not very inclusive
1,i wake up in the morning really disappointed thati am still here pretty sure its never going to get better i literally dont see how it would be and even if it doesi am still all alone so whats the damn point 
1,i physically cant cry anymore i dont have the motivation to talk to anyone about anything anymore i just feel dead and broken and i just want my life to be over i just make everyone i love and care about hate me because they should they just fucking shouldi amjust judgmental and needy and clingy and self centered i try to make other people happy but i just end up talking about my own problems instead of helping other people which is all i wanted to do in the first placei ama miserable pathetic excuse for a human being and i deserve death in every single way 
1,sucidal thoughts are on my mind so often hi everyone first of all i would like to say thank you to everyone who is in this community to help others thats something the world needs and i really appreciatei dont know what to do with my life anymore today i received another bad news schoolrelated but it really doesnt matter that made me think once again of suicide lately ive been thinking of it literally everyday even for just a few minutes a day or sometimes a whole hour i like the idea of letting everything go and being truely free but i dont want to be this selfishdying is a common thought in my mind and i find this so sick how can someone think about death so often and enjoy the thought needless to say i dont like my life luckilyi am not disabled and i dont have particular mental problems or at least not thati amaware of i have a girlfriend and a mother who loves me these last two are the only reasons of whyi am not leaving this world i live day by day trying to be grateful of what i already have but this is not the life i want to have and it feels so bad to accept everything instead of having more i love my mother and my girlfriend shes also aware of my problem but never been able to help never seen a doctor either but i am not willing to i hate everyone else i hate my family and the few friends i have its surely because of me we have to work on ourselves before blaming on others and i did but its not my fault if the world is so crueli am tired of all the awful things that happen on a daily basis not just directly to meim agnostic and i believe there is a god i always needed some sort of connection with it but the only thing i had ever was a dream of around two years ago in that dream i saw god whos not a specific entity its everyone and everywhere and a kind of love ive never felt before i felt the peace of me and everyone in the universe that dream for me was what there is after death pure inconditional love with no past present or future during years i understood that love heals ive been having suicidal thoughts since several years not at all with this intensity though and something that always helped me was meditation my kind of meditation at least smoking also helped now everything seems just pointless i belong here if i am and so do you but whats the point of living a sad life in a world ruled by evil the only thing ive ever asked for was complete peace of mind and i pretty much never had it lord knowsi never visualize my future when i do i just imagine what could happen but i just dont knowi am not even sure if i will still be living ive always been unsure about my future since i can remember and thats something i find pretty weird because most of people has a pretty clear vision of what i want to do in life but i do not i dont expect to receive help or answers here i just wanted to share my little story thanks to all of the people who spend time reading this subreddit and helping each other of course thats my opinion but it was like i was dead in that dream and everything was just fine ive never felt anything like that before nor after

1,stds cancer depression anxiety i just wish i could disappear i have multiple incurable stds and a gynecological cancer i wish i could just die or disappear i cant seem to bring myself to kill myself i am worried about leaving my mom and dad and them needing care i often think about when they pass i can pass too and join them i dont feel right being alive i feel i wasnt meant to me here in this body or whatever i am not meant to be loved and my body has made sure of that i have no family beyond my immediate family i sometimes close my eyes and wish i would just start crumbling away i hurt so much
1,dunno what to do but someone is afraid of me and id rather be dead than be someones bogeyman she and i were good friends for a while then i fell in love then a week later she said no thanks very much and cut off contact i knew shed been going through a really hard time and the more friends the merrier so i did my best to fall out of love again but it was cripplingly difficult id never had any of those feelings before when i succeeded eventually i tried to reach out and say that i hoped we could agree to forgive and forget and that if she ever needs someone to talk to then i remain a friend for my part but i made some dumb but understandable mistakes along the way and she now believesi ama dangerous psychopathic stalker i wanted to try and help alleviate some of her troubles and nowi ama cause of them shes afraid of me i dont want her to be id rather be dead and i certainly believe i dont deserve to live after this if she knew i was dead she wouldnt be afraid of me and you dont feel guilty for the death of a monster but at the same time i have friends and family who dont think i did anything immoral and although i dont contribute much to them or to society id be letting them down i dont know what to do i just know that if i knew it would make things better for her i would choose to die its been months since i was in love with her but i love her very much if that makes any sense thats something that will never be understood or believed because sticking someone in the monster box and keeping them there is easier than actually forgiving them what would you do if someone you cared about was terrified of you how could you know that and justify being alive

1,i just want someone to hear me for once i was going to write something big but i feel like the amount of unfair shit that happens in my life is just too long to write out so i will try and just list it out and if you want elaborations just message me or relate message me or something btw sorry but its super long and i didnt mean to ive tried killing myself once and called the suicide hot line but the lady made me feel like i should kill myself even more my life sucks and i amalmost 20 but treated like a 2 yo my mother told me i was the biggest disappointment of her life during my hs graduation she tells mei amugly and should wear makeup both my parents have called me a bitch and my mom calls me a whore my so called friends are shit my ex and his best friend decided to pull a nasty ass prank on me once which basically resulted in almost slut shamming me and then them telling me they were sorry a friend told me he was there for me but when i want to talk he doesnt listen and tells mei amself centered and when he comes over to my house he says he doesnt want to date me and were just friends yet hell kiss me and cuddle me and hump me my two main guy friends say theyre my friends and want to make my summer here good fyii amback for summer since i go to oregon for school now but they never invite me to do stuff i feel like my moms ways and thoughts are super off from the cool kids parents who always get to go out and do stuff all the time becausei amhardly ever invited to ever go out to parties and do stuff that when i do get invited i jump at the opportunity and my mom tells mei ameasy and stupid for doing that and should say no and make myself hard to get wtf why is it that other girls get to go out and do shit and my friends will do stuff for these other girls like throw going away parties and birthdays and invite them to do stuff but i never get asked to do anything like this like am i not pretty enough do i need to be a model or ambassador for a clothing company and be miss teen something to get the attention or just simply the level of things these other girls get and does that make me self centered for wanting these things that i never got does that make me a bitch its constantly having these kinds of things that make me want to kill myself sometimes or just fucking do something that will get me killed because i feel like no one in my life gives a fuck about me and that life defiantly wants to make surei amgiven the most worst fucks ever and i have so many more things in my life that are so much worse but id probably be writing fucking forever if i said them all and then i feel bad for ranting like this because theres a gazillion other people who probably have it a lot worse but for once cant i just be mad and have a right to feel this way without someone coming to say fucking suck it up cuz your life is basically shit and no one cares and half the people you talk to dont care about your problems and the other half are happy you have them

1,am i or am i not suicidal i think about suicide a lot not necessarily doing it though just suicide in general i think about ways of doing it i think about what it would be like if i did i think about how common and easy it would be i dont sit here and tell myselfi am going to do it thoughabout mei am19 ive graduated highschool in 2016 with grades above average hated school still do i havent started college yet instead ive been working for 10 months at a nearby retail store i live with my grandparents so i have no bills to pay ive just been saving up moneyi amblessed i should say my dad works nearly nonstop my mom died when i was 4 what i do wheni am not working is working on music ive been making alternativeelectronic music since the age of 15 and right nowi amworking towards having my debut studio album released its not happening anytime soon though my dad and i are trying to build a studio at his house but due to how much he works and how much it costs to redo an entire room from the bone all i can do is continue to write material for it and expand on arranging the songs anyways back to my issuei am not depressed i dont think anywaysi am not sad nothing is bothering me nobody is abusing me i simply think about suicide a lot and not on purpose i dont know if its a subconscious thing and i am soaking up toxicity from something or ifi amjust interested in death i tend to make jokes a lot not jokes about suicide but jokes about me personally myself committing suicide for example just recently at work my coworker was flipping a coin and he accidentally let it go to the ground and before he could check it i quickly said if its heads i go to the break room and kill myself and he shot me a shockedconcerned look i wonder why but anyways as soon as i said that even i was like wow did i really just say that 4 times now ive received either the suicide prevention lifeline number from my friends or simply them reaching out and offering support if i need itim kind of concerned that this is only going to get worse and during yet another timei amstaring at my bottle or aspirin or the bottle of bleach i have on my windowsill above my bed thinking about how i could do it right now if i wanted to that i really am just going to do it and like the jokes i make be surprised that i did it and regret it assuming its something thats not instant i am a huge mess but i know i have the capability to become a much better person would it be worth it if i did though would a haircut a shave a shower a new set of clothes a new attitude and a new work ethic have any impact on this at all i dont knowi amjust rambling now soi amgonna stop here what do i do i feel as if theres some kind of demon or other thing thats controlling my mind i dont want to kill myself but i amtalking thinking and acting like i do and i dont know why i am not depressed stressed or angered by anything yet i think about suicide in general quite often i dont know why i do and i amconcerned for my own being
1,24 ptsd suicide is seeming like the practical and economic decision girlfriend of three years broke up with me last month ive been staying with my abusive family members since its going to take at least three months of me living here before ive saved up enough for my own housing and transportation i could probably have a gun tomorrow ive been in therapy for like 7 years the other day i had a physician tell me i was refractory to treatment and he refused to become involved in my care feeling pretty hopeless girlfriend was more or less all i had and my mental i willness drove her away no friends to depend on family is actively making things worse i live in a state with abysmal mental health care ive reached out to all of the major institutions at some point and havent gotten the help i need once when i was being taken to psychiatric hold i told a paramedic i was sorry but i am not going inpatient in my state the paramedic responded by grabbing my hand and saying i knowi amexcited to stop struggling honestly not existing sounds more wonderful than any future i can imagine i want to stop suffering being as mentally i will as i am i knowi am not ever going to stop sufferingi amnever going to be gifted the ability emotionally regulate like a normal person everyday life events are excruciating and frankly the constant emotional pain makes my quality of life indefensible pretty sure i would qualify for euthenasia at this point if i was living in the netherlands dont even know whyi amposting this
1,i feel like a parasite my happiness relies mostly on others and its been this way as long as i can remember being depressed some backgroundi ama 19 year old woman that has suffered with severe depression and anxiety for almost ten years ive been really struggling with my mental health especially since i graduated high school in june of 2016 i feel like i have no purpose no matter what i end up doing when youre depressed this long your interests and ambitions have long disappeared along with your happiness which fucking sucks my life is going absolutely nowhere in a job or education sense ive been seeing a man for a few months now wed been friends for over two years before this i love him more than anything but its so draining because i feel likei amonly existing for him his life is progressing beautifully and i feel likei amholding him down ive fucked up a lot of peoples minds in the past when it comes to my suicidal tendencies and i absolutely cannot hurt him like that its driving me mad that i have to deal with these emotions day in and day out i feel likei amwasting his time and i just want him to be happy even if i ended up staying alive i dont think i could fulfill the happiness he deserves hes the most beautiful and compassionate person ive met in my life and the last thing i want to do is traumatize him i hate being stuck i wish i could just get in a fatal car accident so no one would feel like they were to blame or maybei amjust delaying the inevitable maybe i should just take the plungei am tired of feeding off of people words

1,i think about killing myself everyday at work i used to think about it once every few months just in passing but since i started working full time its been more frequent until it became a daily thing i thought it was fine until it started following me home my job isnt even that hard or taxing its just a ninehour shift hour long lunch i can leave the building thats off the clock so 8 paid hours decent pay good benefits so i really shouldnt be having these thoughtsits even affecting my enjoyment of things i cant even enjoy games anymore as it stands the only thing that i do enjoy now is writing shitty fanfiction and the feedback i get for that what should i do

1,forced medical leave from college 3 years ago i will never recover from need to die 3 years ago i was forced against me and my parents will to take a medical leave from my dream college it was a prestigious school that i worked my ass off in high school to get into sacrificing a social life for gradesextracurriculars because i wanted so bad to get into a good college and have a great experience halfway into the school year i started getting very depressed and became anorexic but was seeking help outside the school for both these problems and was hopeful of my recovery that was until one of my teachers expressed concern about my weight to administration what followed was months of back and forth harassment threats forced tests and evaluations that cost my parents money out of pocket etc including mandatory weekly meetings with one of the deans only to culminate in them forcing me to take a medical leavei was in a certain program in this school where basically if i were to leave i would lose my spot in the program and have to start all over more time at the school more money for my parents same classes over bullshit i had literally chosen that school because of the prestige of this program and the first year was a sort of preparation for the program and i already had befriended people in the group was excited that all my hard work first year would finally pay off it was really really stressful for me and my family and when i tried to go back the next semester my application was denied and i was still prevented from returning next semester same thing i have literally not recovered from this event and it has ruined my entire life and even health since this happened ive developed severe lifealtering chronic pain leaving me bedridden that therapists tell me is from the stressanger of that situation both my mom and dad have developed emotional issuesanxiety having to watch me suffer the dr bills that are a result of this event have piled up for my poor parents i have watched all of my friends recently graduate and move on with their lives whilei amcompletely stuck i had such a bright future and its literally gonei am so sick mentally and physically i cant work and i am so angry i could literally see myself murdering the people at that school that so unfairly did that to me and still wouldnt let me returni cannot see any way out ive been completely isolated from every human but my parents and doctors for the past three years i havent gone out with any friends or done anything a normal young person should do in all this time i see zero future for myself without a degree and no clear path and the pain prevents me from even holding the most easy of jobs theres legitimately no way out for me anymore ive held on so long and i cant anymore fuck this world the phony people incapable of empathy and understanding and the unfairness that permeates through innocent peoples lives and souls

1,ive burned everything around mei am not the usual one to wax poetic about my suicidal thoughts but thought this might be a good platform to spew a little bit ive been suicidal for years and yet the past few weeks really seem like a sign that it is time to go1 i have destroyed my relationship with the one i love by not being there emotionally and by my actions its to the point where her 13 year old brother is angry at me for not being more responsible i put her in an unsafe situation2 my car has completely broke down and i do not have the funds to replace it which means that i have no means of transportation of getting to and from work3 ive been missing more and more days of work management may fire me any day from now my only source of income4 my family is upset because they do not know how to handle me ive never been more distant from them5 my friends are angry at me as well for multiple reasons i have nobody i can confide in6 i went to my doctor today to pour out my feelings he prescribed me antidepressants and sent me away7 i start school again next week and i cant even concentrate on writing this post let alone study8 my physical health is deteriorating and i am in constant physical pain i also have been struggling with insomnia and cry myself to sleep every nighti have been a dick but i feel like karma is hitting me with full force or there is a sign out there that its time for me to go ive tried everything meditation exercise sleeping more confiding in others to help but i feel like the more i am in peoples lives at this point the more i am burning them i dont know what to do every day i wake up life is throwing something else at me and i keep making the wrong decisions ive never been more ready to die and yeti am still too cowardly to go through the act i just want the pain to stop i want to stop being a cancer in other peoples lives theres nothing worse than ruining someone elses life its one thing to ruin yours but to ruin somebody elses is a feeling of guilt and pain that i dont know what to do with i have tried apologizing but every time i come back i find a way to make things worsei am so scared and in so much pain 
1,apparentlyi amhatednot welcome anywhere in a matter of 3 months i got kicked out from every forum and abandoned by every friendup to yesterday i was staff in a website today i get kicked out and framed since i was pissed i deleted some of the files on the ftp but they changed the ip and restored everything i realized i would have done much more destruction through the admin control panel via ftp but i didnt realize that until after i got kicked out from other forums for not taking shit from the staff for example in one of them i created something and one of the staff decided to steal it and declare it as his own that caused me to leak the source code for everyone to use and both me and the mod lost sales i felt better that he couldnt monetize from that any longer this led to me being blacklisted from every event the whole staff team would do or actual staff applications another forum incident was i was selling another one of my programs of course no license sincei amlazy to add that in this guy buys it and shares the license with his friend once something went wrong with the program he his friend and about 30 more decided to mock me and bring my reputation down then he demanded i help him and his friends and i refused due to him breaking my purchase policies the staff sided with this guy and got me banned for not refundingfixing his programfor the friend part i stopped coding and spent most of my time playing games with them 34 in short i realized that only one really wanted me there and the other 3 preferred to play without me i like being kind of a leader saying what to do what not to do and what i should do instead of them such as lets drop there pubg or let me be that character since you dont really know how to use it rainbow six siege all my online friends found other friends to talk to play with code with my best friend found a job and is working 8 hours a day and going everywhere without me with minimum contact with me the only times he invites me out i actually cant meet him due to me being with my girlfriend being the weekends basicly now i have nowhere to go or anything to do rather than code but what is the point of coding if i cant sell my creations anywhere in their specific famous forums i go to gym every morning and sleep at 5 am the only person who ignores my leadership characteristic is my girlfriend and she puts up with all my crap she basicly is the only person that makes me feel happy and wanted i dont know why on the contrary everyone else hates me and wants me to be gone being hated by everyone means i cant sell my creations or have anything to talk about with anyone on the forums part i cant let anyone take advantage of me and step on me and control what i do what is wrong with me in your opinion i really want to get better and be liked by the majority rather than hated by the majority

1,whats the point of living when youre gonna die eventually one way or another dont know when just that death is going to happen someday and theres no stopping it from happeningmight as well try to kill myself now before something or someone brings me to my death first
1,i feel bad for those who care about me i feel bad for the people who waste their time on me ive been completely fucked for years and yet there are still people who remain around me by choice despite myself and how ive treated themthats not really why i feel bad though i feel bad because i know eventually thati am going to end my life not today maybe not even soon but to me sayingi amgonna end up dead by my own hand is like saying water is wet or the sky is blue i feel bad for these people because they hold out hope that my opinions on life will change and that one day i will be happy and have the things i clamor for it will never happen either because of its inherent impossibility or because i will prevent it by killing myselfim not even remotely upset while typing this which further cements how much i believe this it doesnt even scare me its just reality

1,lately ive had a problem a lot of kids know what they want to be when they grow up it usually changes by the time they get there but usually if people have a passion they can stick with it others cant say they have a passion so theyre confused about what to do with their lives i seem to have a different problem while i accept that i am by no stretch of the imagination a tragic person i wrestle with the certainty that i will never know everything i want to know i dont just want to be a doctor or a lawyer i want to be a linguist i want to be a chemist a physicist an historian and marine biologist i want to be a philosopher and a world traveler and a surfer and everything in between on a daily basis this is fine because what i want changes from day to day some days everything else falls away and medieval poetry fills my view other days its i willegal drugs or covert military operations one time it was hypnosis and i spent three hours reading the entire wikipedia page for it and looking for psychologists whove written on it this is all fine because my sporadic learning is financially supported by my mom and dad but what happens once i grow up what happens i have bills to pay i want to see every country speak every language climb every mountain and taste every rainbow but i cant do that ifi amforced to survive instead of live i am mortally terrified that no life no living arrangement no outcome or possibility waiting for me in all of reality will ever make me happy i used to be able to ignore this feeling but its been getting stronger i have no idea what to do my problem isnt that i dont have any passion its that i have too much i knowi amonly 17 but what do i do

1,anxietyfuelled suicidal thoughts ive struggled with anxiety for much of my life and it has brought me to the edge of suicide on a few occasions i never made any actual attempts i just had very clear plans that i backed out of at the last or nearly last moment when i was 16 i thought i wouldnt live to see 20 at 20 i thought id be dead by 25 at 25 the age moved back to 30 now at 29 i dont expect to kill myself imminently but i believe it will be how i die finally after 29 years i realized that my anxiety brings me here the fear and worry just grips my mind and wont let go either i fear so much about what is happening or i worry so much about what will happen i start to feel as if suicide is the only way to save me from myself two weeks ago i almost made this post i was in a dark place i held off later i recovered that lasted about four days nowi amback right where i left off afraid worrying wanting to escape the last time i had a plan i planned to jump of a bridge nearby where i live a bridge that many people have successfully used to kill themselves in the past last time i also tried to put my affairs in order before i killed myself now my plan is still valid and my affairs are still in order i dont think i will kill myself tonight i feel i will kill myself soon i have often felt that way though the frequency with which i feel like killing myself makes me not want to seek help for it why worry others when i know i wont do it but i feel like i will do it maybe not tonight but sooni am not sure where this post is heading it would be helpful for me to hear how others deal with suicidal thoughts driven by their own anxiety again i dont want to die like many here i just dont want to live like this 
1,unemployment blues why dont i feel like doing much to help myself i lost my job in july bit of a blessing in disguise there as it was as a cashier at walmart a shit place to work if ever there was one and have been unemployed since they fought my unemployment money so that never arrived after i applied just fucking hate themi amdisabled with cp and walmart as a rule seems not to give a shit about ada they fought and thankfully lost against each of my reasonable accommodations and in general were indifferent and uncaring to my physical and mental suffering at their handsbut enough about all that thinking about them at all just infuriates me morei am26 and without a job fortunately i had built up a bit of a financial cushion soi am not entirely in dire straits yet thing is ive dealt with pretty severe clinical depression for most of my life and even attempted suicide in march after my managers threatened to fire me after i was scammed several hundred dollars in prepaid cards by a group of known criminalsso here i am two months out and losing hope of finding fulltime employment quickly enough that my current cash doesnt run out i cannot stand for long so that rules out most fast food placesnot that id want to lower myself to thati have a fouryear english ba for gods sake my options with no real experience in my chosen field are unfortunately quite slimim just getting tired again and apathetic about continuing to search for anything meaningful out there on the internet job boardsi amon a new antidepressant again and its actually working most of the time it takes the edge off at least it would buoy me up to a level plateau aka normal whereas before i was mostly in the deep dark pit and it was an effort to even rise to that normal level to say nothing of anything about itsoi amjust getting worn out yet again i know i need to be really looking for a jobbut i just cant muster the willpower most daysi am in bed until ten or later and then i will catch a nap around two or so in the afternoon wake up again around five or six and stay up until two or three or later in the morning rinse repeat
1,i would would make a throwaway but i dont anyone will find this j cant complain too much but i do today at dinner that my exfianc e will explain took me out to will explain i said something profound at least to myselfi ambeing destroyed by apathy driven by anxiety and for depression everyday i actually just lost someone my cousin only a few years older than me due to a bullet in his head that he placed there which made me to say another profound thing at this date of disasteri really dont care about others or understand why i feel the ways i feel i only last my grandma a few months ago and doesnt care but cried over my cousin when i never spoke to him which ive been thinking a lot about i have no friends which i hate and just moved starts away from all my family i dont know if i love anyone how can i when i constantly hate myself i contemplate suicide a lot for stupid small things but for big things i usually just break down into an anxiety filled seizure or depression laced nap i really just dont know what to think about life or myself or this cruddy situation 
1,sometimes i feel really suicidal i was diagnosed with adhd half a year ago but i feel like it is too late to get things straight i have been taking medication but i think we need many years to catch up so i think i will suffer after graduationbesides that i have no friends i think quite a number of people in my major are avoiding me and being short with me maybe i depended on the acquaintances for help too many times and missed too many classes and had to whatsapp them asking if there are schedule changes and they dont like how i have the management skills of a 12 year oldi feel like we will be forever inferior to neurotypicals and that we will never be accepted by society and it makes me want to die as some people have said they arent exactly supportive of us having kids as we are just passing it on to the second generation and causing them to suffer for a lifetime
1,my guitar is the only thing that is keeping me alivecheesy i know sorry my family is in debt because of my father he refinanced the house and used the money for his mistresses yes that bastard had more than one mistress at the same time he passed away last year he may be dead but the debt is still yet to be settlednow here i am broke unemployed and a disappointment to my family i spent my savings on trying to make something of my life with music where i formed a few bands and hoped to become a full time musician alas none of them worked out due to the bandmembers either being too playful or no commitment at allim unemployed because i tried to get myself a typical 95 job i did get one but it only lasted about 5 months because of how horrible the working environment is and its messing up my peace of mindmy family was a bit disappointed when i made that decision because i am unable to force myself to work just for the sake of salary sometimes i hate that fact as well but what can i do its just my personality i guess now here i am sitting in front of my computer with nothing left for me to lose except my life and pondering on the remains of my enthusiasm towards lifethe six strings in my room is probably the only thing that acts as a mental painkiller for me but i dont even know how long it can last its a shame that my country is against euthanasia else i probably wouldve resort to that without blinking an eyehehmaybe i should borrow some money from my siblings go to canada and get the injection and just be done with it thats probably on my list yeahanyway sorry for the long post thank you so much for reading this

1,amvery close to ending it i found out my relationship is a lie in a lot of ways our life has been really hard for the past year or so we both have been stressed out and mean to each other hes violent when hes mad not towards me though hell scream at me and break my things and he punches books and walls and our bed whilei amon it he was once very sweet and reasonable and i think ive just worn him down by being my old depressive self our relationship was the only thing ive felt okay about in my life it used to give me so much hope and i was going to work hard on myself but we both have to work a lot and were still broke and i cant afford to buy a phone even though ive been without one for two weeks i havent signed up for classes this semester he feels closer to his best guy friend and i understand that but i actually thought i was his best friend i found out that he basically despises me and talks about it with his friend all the timei really just dont have the energy or the fortitude to try any longer ive felt empty my whole life and my whole life ive tried to fill myself with hobbbies and goals and other people ive felt this way as long as i can remember and i tried so hard with this relationshipi just feel like my life will suck no matter whati am not good at anything and even the people who love me cant stand meive written out a long post to my friends and family i have my method here with me and i ampretty surei am going to do this i dont have a working phone and suicide chat hasnt worked the last few times ive tried to use it theyre always offlinei wanted to be stronger than this but i dont feel strong wheni amjust letting a life that i fucking hate happen to me eitheredit update i actually tried to end it and my method didnt work i dont have access to quicker methods and i guess thats for the best though i dont really know how to feel i stepped over that threshold though i was there i was trying to kill myself and in spite of my best effortsi am still alive i no longer feel as desperate to die but i am still just not happy and it just seems like something i will try another day when the occasion arises he stopped me he was at work and he came home and found me and we both cant stop cryingi am still feeling pretty hopeless about our relationship but hes been fighting for it he always decides to step up wheni amdone though and i expect him to phase back into his usual patterns and demeanor within 3 or 4 days
1,requesting all counselors this isnt even a throwaway account but i have all the typical suicidal thoughts etc one thing that frequently triggers them are jobs getting the same old well you arent going to like everyone you work with or work is work its part of the real world all that bullshit i hate it i dont want to put any effort in to living a pointless life but i have a skill in wording convincing chicks for nudes hmu i thought about it and counselors get some decent pay not trying to be a dick but counselling isnt that hard i find giving advice easy and i find talking one on one about a sensitive topic to be easy also i reckon after a little bit of learning the right wording techniques id be pretty damn good at it should i pursue it i have had my fair share of anxiety suicidal thoughts etc perhaps a job as a counselor is a possibility

1,destiny i started college one week after my 16th birthday i got a huge academic scholarship to go to a nice private university and everyone was so proud of me i got used to everyone boosting my ego and calling me a genius everything started going downhill when i started dabbling in the drugs drinking and partying i was such a smart kid but the pressure to keep being the person when i started struggling a lot in school because i wanted to be friends with all the wrong people through my newfound freedom in college i never really found that balance in college between friends and academics it was either one or the other when i was 18 i racked up thousands in credit card debit that i can never escape but it was okay because i kept up that facade of a care free lifestyle growing up dirt poor and abused for all of my life until i left for college this was the life i thought i deserved for all of my handwork wrong i shouldve kept trying harder but my parents never taught me how to be a good person i cant blame them entirely though because i know now what is right and what is wrong but i choose the wrong path every time at 19 i didnt do so well on my grad school entrance exam so i had to retake and take a year off well this wasnt really an option for me because i would always take massive student loans out to be able to live in nice apartments and not have to actually have a job i didnt think i could get a job with my major either this was where things really fell apart my parents pressured me into staying in school for another year and take out those loans because they made me believe i wouldnt last in the real world without financial aid turns out they were stealing money from me for 4 years through my financial aid account and were trying to keep the cash flow going during this year i was so ashamed to tell my friends that i hadnt gotten a degree so i lied i lied to everyone all the time that i got my degree then the lies got bigger because that wasnt enough to appear normal i became a babysitter while taking online classes didnt want to run into anyone on campus but i lied all over social media and in person that i had this kickass lifestyle and job i feel horrible that i did all of that but i just wanted to be fit in like all of my young professional friends i couldnt because i had the maturity of a 20 year oldat 20 things started looking up i got into grad school with a great scholarship i was so happy my parents were finally proud of me again everything felt great again because i had buckled down and tried so hard to get into the 75th percentile of my entrance exam then things started getting bad again during the summer i was taking 3 classes that i needed to pass in order to get my degree and start grad school finally i couldve graduated a year ago but i kept going to school for financial aid this was the worst decision of my life i had signed my lease already in a different city had a roommate borrowed 3000 for various expenses thought i was going to be reimbursed with my scholarship and i event went to orientation i dont know what happened i dont know what i did to become so stupid but i failed one of the required classes by 02 i needed a 60 to pass and i got a 598 i pleaded with the professor and then appealed to the dean i got a cold callous response how could i miss the final exam because i thought it was optional i had read the syllabus over and over i had sat in class why couldnt i focus and comprehend what happened to me why did the words get jumbled up when i read them and i couldnt understand this has never happened to me before the professor and the dean thought i was incompetent which i am i explained everything to them about my situation and what failing the class would mean my professor told me your destiny is in your hands not mine i fucked up my destiny i couldnt tell anyone about this not even the people closest to me in my life because i had already spun everyone this web of lies luckily the grad school let me defer for a year because during the year that i spent leaching off of financial aid and after i got into grad school i started failing my classes because i didnt think they mattered my gpa dropped by 45 i couldnt get into the school again if i had to reapply stupid right i made stupid decisions and i became stupidwhere am i today well its supposed to be my first month of grad school in a new city surrounded by passion for the field i love and intelligent wonderful people but instead i am sharing a one bedroom apartment with my older brother who supports me in every aspect of life i love and appreciate him so much because hes the one person i can be honest with because i know hell love me anyways i cant get a good job because i dont have a degree i dont really know whati am going to be doing for this next year but i barely ever leave the apartment or do anything thats not watching tv and getting highi amlostmy breaking point of how much everything sucks is that this man harassed and berated me in the parking garage for almost hitting him while on my way up he followed me all the way up to my assigned parking spot waited for me to get out of the car with my groceries and started screaming at me when i did i calmly apologized but he wouldnt stop i have been so hurt since that happened last week because i already have horrible selfesteem and negative interactions like that just destroy me he just wouldnt leave me alone and i didnt understand why my kindness didnt fix things yesterday i got a package and attempted to pick it up from the leasing office they said i couldnt because it had my brothers name on it weird because i know it was mine my brother came down this morning and they said i couldnt get any mail delivered here because my name wasnt on the lease and further went on to say that i almost hit someone in the parking garage so they lied to me yesterday i cant even stand up for myself my name cant be on the lease because my parents fucked up my renters history and i have terrible credit i feel trapped in a one bedroom box another reason not to leave my house anymore i cant do anything right i cant even live like a hermit righti dont know howi am going to finish this year off i just feel so broken i used to be this beautiful successful witty and full of life girl but underneath all of that is just the person i am today a leech a liar a worthless filler of space i thought i could change my life and make some difference but i cant escape my destiny i try to be nice to people and i get walked all over all my friends are moving on and here i am digging myself into a deeper hole
1,concerned for a friend wont add too many details as they browse reddit heavily a friend has always been the type to joke and troll a lot but lately she has seemed very depressed staying home most of the time seeing no point to normal living this person wants the whole world to be at their beck and call and anything less isnt worth living it sounds clinically delusional to me like severely warped expectations at the same time we hang out and have a good time from time to time and all seems well but the way they casually talk about killing themselves not in a joking way in a very serious way obviously has me concerned i have been reaching out and i am trying to be a very positive voice in her life and it seems like things are marginally improving over time i would be worried that reporting my friend to a suicide watch or pushing them into therapy might alienate them from one of their only friends and positive influences me so far i feel good about the progress made but it would be devastating if they went through with a suicide and i didnt do everything possible to prevent it would welcome any advice 
1,lonely depressed and suicidal hello everyonerecently ive been in a state where for the past couple of weeks now ive been at a loss of any kind of interaction with my friends for further context i found that even with new friends that ive made through school hospitalization etc just dont care about me and i feel as if they pass me off as if i dont exist before pushing them away because of this in these past couple of weeks i would always genuinely wonder how they were doing so id ask with little to no responses i just know it goes a long way with me when someone takes time to ask me howi am doing so id try to communicate with my friends as much as possible because i love and care about them but would they say the same back the thing is in these past few months any friend that ive had has left me for something or someone better over different situations and those that still try and put minimal effort into being relevant in my life rarely ever call or text to say hi or ask howi am doing it hurts you knowi am not trying to come off as egotistical but ive always cared for people in my life and i always look to let them know i care just by being there for them whenever and i guess maybei aminvisible to them or not important on their own paths in life based on how they treat me back its always been me texting or calling first despite the immense amounts of anxiety that it gives mei am sorry i know it doesnt sound like much of a problem but i havent always had friends just recently in high school sophomore year junior now was when things started to pick up for me in my social life things were going great for awhile actually and now like i shouldve anticipated everything seems to be against me people i used to talk to dont bother with me anymore i cant show my face in school because of rumors spread last school year and even those friends that stuck after those rumors settled the ones that i knew wouldnt buy the bullshit have just seemed to vanish i guess they werent saying anything to me for days so i just turned my phone off because i was hurting enough already from other things i wont talk about in this i turned it on to post this however and there was still nothing i dont know what i did to those close friends i still had i barely know why rumors were started about me other than that i heard my ex spread them to see me suffer again when i and they knew that i was moving on and doing better in short i dont know whyi ambeing treated like this high school is a nasty place being a teenager is even worse my depression and anxiety have seemed to skyrocket from years ago and only keep affecting me more and more everyday and i just dont know how much more of it i can take ive already been hospitalized because of a suicide attempt several months ago over being trapped in my own thought and because of those rumors that ultimately led to a bad rep harassment and bullying to notei am still harassed by people connected with my ex which i also guess goes as cyberbullying as well another reason why i keep my phone off i just wish those people knew the truth i wish they couldve heard me crying for days and nights on end because of how one false rumor led to a lot truly a lot that i my family friends that stuck with me and god even my ex probably subtly knew i didnt deserve anyway being in that mental hospital for a week put a lot of strain on my family and honestly being lonely like this everyday sure as hell doesnt benefit them as it only makes my depression so much worse to be isolated like this my point is the thoughts of thinking that life is meaningless are returning because my experiences in life have only proven that this happens time and time again never has a single person in my life just seemed to have cared like legitimately as in sure ive had nurses that have taken care of me therapists that listen to me and other forms of support but theres one thing in common with them all and its that they likely know theyre being paid to care about me saying that sounds fucked but i do know theyre goodhearted people its just paying people to hear me out doesnt seem too right in my mind i think its more right that we should be able to share our emotions our problems and just pay ourselves in the way of knowing that we simply helped someone id say the only person that cares deep down is my mom but ive stopped telling her about my problems because i feel as if itd be easier for her if i stopped and just died after all the emotional stress ive especially put on her and the rest of my familyi am in the process of writing and rewriting notes for when i decide to leave its only a matter of time before something new pushes me over the edge or when that thought telling me that life will always be like this wins and itd truly be for good this time i promise myself that maybe i should set a date and if things arent better by then yeahim sorry if this was long i needed a place to put my mind onto paper where people would see it and hopefully understand me for once in a long long time ive never sent or posted anything this long so i may regret and delete it but the thought will still remain from the paragraph before this one back to binging netflix i should also note that my mom thinksi amslowly becoming anorexic based on how little she thinks i eat everyday and the weight loss shes noticed i dont know if this is the right place to post about that but regardless ive come to realize after a bit she may be right we all struggle with something so from my heart i hope the best and most peaceful moments for everyone here feel free to reply id really appreciate it goodnight

1,i feel like i cant breathe i was hospitalized twice over the past two months for my mental health issues i thought i was improving but these past few weeks have been shit and tonight ive just been spontaneously crying and having frequent panic attacks i dont want to end it but at the same time i feel i must for being the sort of person i am a worthless ugly female of all things with no talents of any kind and nothing inherently decent to offeri dont know how much more of this i can take i want to scream or just lie down forever
1,am still alive my lack of knowledge where the heart is made me miss the fatal blow by few inches away why didnt they just let me diei amsick and tired of people saying i got my life ahead of me and i am still young and i shouldnt kill myself and i amjust overeacting to a heart break well this heart break had just killed me in the inside whats wrong to be completely dead ive got nothing left inside me now love is a very funny because the thing is no matter how hard i tell her that she meant alot to me how much i tell her i love her how i would sacrifice everything just to be with her and yet she just look away from it like my feelings doesnt mean anything to her its so hard to confess that you love someone that you adore everything about them but its so easy to say no to shot you down just because you missed out certain thing that they want the feeling of dying seems alot comforting than to live one of more second of my pathetic life 
1,am not me anymore sorry if this is all over the placebeen depressed for as long as i can remember always try to smile on the outside but insidei amdead anxiety social anxiety depression and i thinki ambipolar 21 and havent got a job yet nobody to stand by me nobody to tell me its ok not like id believe them anyways were basically homeless right now so i cant just leave my mom and sister like that once we get our place though i think itll be my time been cutting my wrists to see if it would hurt it didnt carved fuck into my leg didnt feel a thing weed is my fucking lifeline right now but whenever i run out in comes the depressed state where i just want to sleep all day wish i would just get shot or stabbed already i no longer fear the razor though so thats probably gonna be my way out dont know exactly when or where but i know its gonna happen cant think straight anymore fuck life 
1,everyday of my life everyday i wake up i think of suicide even though i dont want to die i dont want to live if it means that this is to be my life always alone always searching always fighting always living everyday of my life so empty

1,i have no motivation and want to die i cant get myself motivated to do anything anymore i want to succeed in life and go to a good university but i can never make the effort needed to get it done very rarely i get glimpses of motivation but as soon as something isnt the way i thought it would be i plummet and lose all hope for my future and my life every day i think about how i want to die and ways of doing it and when i should do it i think the only thing stopping me from doing it is how it would affect my family but lately i cant help myself from thinking about how they might not care i usually can convince myself they will but lately it had been getting harderi cant maintain a normal sleep schedule anymore now i just sleep till 5pm and am awake till 8am ive tried to talk to family or even councilors about what is happening but ive lost trust in telling my family these things and the last councilor started to ignore our calls to book appointments whenever i do try to tell people how i feel i cant fully tell them the truth and end up lying to them so they dont have to worryi hate everything about myself i hate my hobbies i hate how i am a failure and i hate how i put on a mask to keep my friends and family from worrying more and more lately i just dont see the point of living and i amstruggling keeping my emotions in check one minute i will be happy sitting there watching a show and the next minute i will be super sad thinking about how i want to die or super angry wanting to break somethingi dont know why i posted this on here maybe its a last ditch effort to see if anyone bothers to reply or say something that might help i fear that one day something will happen with a close family member or friend that will be the breaking point and i wont be able to convince myself not to end my life 
1,amshaking i feel so alone nothing matters number 8 thats the number i got in line for the suicide hotline to even think that 7 other people are in front of me makes it all feel so utterly pointlessim at work everyone just carrying on was thinking about hanging myself i work from home so its not like anyone would notice until the wife got hometold her i really need a therapy visit but the earliest availability for the therapist is the same time she gets off at work asked if she could ask off early she says no she understands why i want her toher job makes her happy unlike mine which makes me want to kill myselfi amtrapped in my house on computers that i barely understand to do thingsi amjust barely capable or incapable of doing always hanging on by a thread 247today feels like a good day to do it i cant leave my job without being marked a failure lots of people depend on me as the sole person working on a big project for my company i cant bear to quit on the spot and be blacklisted from the only job ive ever really held down in my main career fieldim the breadwinner but my wife wants her job to be more important since it helps her escape me and my depressionanxiety the world is going to end soon anyways whether its a super volcano or another world war at least i lived through some good timesat this point i dont even work i just stare blankly at my screen waiting for my time to roll around hoping i will just die to a heart attack from my anxiety so at least i can say i worked myself to death but even that would be a lie i do nothing all day every day being dead would be better than being a leech on some honest and good company that other people depend on for their livelyhoodmy wife doesnt care about how i feel and she knows that i know shes put herself first and i get it id do the same it just feels so horrendously awful that i just want the pain to go away
1,every night i dream of different ways to kill myself ive been watching the show hannibal recently which i think has sparked some pretty wild dreams i always have very vivid and realistic dreams but lately they have been about me committing suicide and they are very gorey spellingi just want it to endi lost my job in june and have been fucked since i could ask my family to borrow money but theyve already helped so much without me asking that i feel so guilty asking for even 20 i applied to drive for lyft and all i have to do is the inspection but my car is out of gas soi amstuck between a rock and a hard place whats really been stressing me out is right after i lost my job i got a ticket for marijuana possession in my car i had a valid doctors recommendation but since i had a bowl packed in my front seat they gave me a ticket the reason i was pulled over was for expired registration which ive paid since i went onto the court website and it told me i qualified to pay the fixit portion for the registration which i believe is 35 my bank accounts are both overdrawn and i maybe have 080 in coins but otherwise the ticket said around 1400 it allowed me to postpone the court date by a month which will now be in a few days i really dont know what to do and cant really ask my family about it because they dont condone smoking weed i know i need to get my original ticket siged to prove my registration is now valid but i still have no way of paying either the fix it portion or the i willegal possession portion of the ticketthe only thing keeping me from quitting is my cat he is my everything he doesnt get along with anyone but me so i know he would be the most devastated if i left him i really dont want to leave him but i feel as though there isnt another choice i rescued another kitten from the streets that my best friend found i opened a care credit card to pay for his vet visits they have been calling every day for the past 2 months asking for payment which i dont have i put him up for adoption on craigslist because he fights with my other cat constantly which pisses me off to no end i was looking forward to a few bucks from it to get me started on lyft so i can maybe start paying things back but my brothers girlfriend found out and wants to take him for her mom i feel terrible asking her for money for him so i didnt she said she will pick him up friday night but i really need the money i dont know what to do i dont know how to feel i just feel hopeless and that is it

1,what if you just dont like living i hate when people say all of the things in your life are fixable because i dont want to die due to personal problemsi hate when people say well find a job you love because i hate the concept of having to work there is nothing thati ampassionate about that i want to turn it into a full time job and even if there was i dont want my passions to turn into yet another means of making money maybe if you have a college degree you have more options as to what youre able to achieve but what about those of us working shit jobs who have no degrees not everyone can drop everything in their lives live in a van and just travel the worldi hate being human i hate how people make assumptions about peoples appearance and then dont bother to see if what they think is true i hate how outgoing narcissistic people get ahead way more than those who are less popular but by no means less qualified i hate how stupid vapid and easily manipulated human beings are the world is just a popularity competition based on how many people like you why should i have to go out of my way to force people to like me this society was shaped by narcissistic sociopaths for their own benefit i dont care how my friends or family will react because emotions are temporary remember no emotion lasts forever and someday maybe not now or in a few months or years theyll get over it life doesnt stop when one person commits suicide and its not like i will be conscious to regret or miss anything id rather die that go on trying to pretend to be like anyone else i will never be that popular outgoing person that everyone flocks to it just isnt me i cant go back to blinding optimism when ive seen so much terrible shit life is cruel heartless and not worth enduring i just see suicide as a way to opt out permanently

1,i think nows my timei am15 i have contemplated killing myself for about a year and i have kind of hit a point i have a great family and a good life with everything i need i just dont see any purpose in life i wake up every morning and curse and punch my wall because i hate living my friends ask me why i look so pissed off and i just say its because i have to come to school i am pissed off that i am alive i wish i could just end it all but i dont want to because my mom dad and sister would be devastated my sister is about to enter college and i dont want her to become so sad that she drops out or becomes distracted i dont want to hurt my parents so bad that they think its their fault or end up suffering for years i also dont want to kill myself because i feel it would be a disservice to all those that are less fortunate then me they might have it so bad but they keep struggling through day to day i have everything i need but yeti am still not satisfied sometimes i lay in bed and cry because i dont see a purpose in living and i think about all the fucked up shit that happens in our world the universe is so big and time moves so fast i dont think anyone would even miss me why does anything i do even matter in the grand scheme of things everything i do good or bad will be lost and forgotten everything i do has no significance and no meaning i want to reach out for help but i just cant bring myself to do it i thought about maybe joining the military and trying to go somewhere dangerous so i could die then at least then at least my parents wouldnt be ashamed of me but that takes to long i need a solution now i have played through the scenario in my head multiple times i would walk in the middle of the night to the freeway overpass and jump off but i just cant bring myself to do it recently my grades have started dropping and my parents are mad at me this is kind of the breaking point if there was already no point in living why make myself suffer more

1,serious question why is suicide considered selfish to many its seen as selfish but to the one whom experiences the want for it its because its an escape from what they feel as a life time of sorrow if this was the case wouldnt it be selfish for the ones around that individual to want himher to keep going if it is just going to be miserablei am not suicidal right now for the most part but this idea crosses my mind a lot any input anyone
1,my take go easy on yourself you might not be perfect but youre definitely a long way from unlovable or irredeemable your lack or fear of intimacy is a self defense mechanism to protect yourself from getting hurt chuck your past experiences in the trash bin and enjoy life just keep an open mind as a backup plan in case things dont work out so you can go back to normal again

1,i just need some help everything in the past year is just a horrible downward spiral okay this is probably going to be annoyingly long but i have to get this out to someonei amsitting in bed so upset that i cant even cry i just got an email that my power bill for the past 30 days is 500 i live in a 3 bed 2 bath apartment in a small georgia town with my boyfriend and our roommate i dont know how on earth we could have possibly used 3000kwh of power in 30 days we operate ac reasonably turn lights off all that the bill is due in 13 days and i dont have a job my boyfriend doesnt have a job i have all the experience i need to get a decent paying professional job ive applied to over 60 places in the past month and a half and the most communication ive gotten is one single email saying theyre going with another candidateive had major depressive disorder since i was 14 years old i have a reasonable control on it but right now i want nothing more than to just stop existing ive been living on my own with my boyfriend for about a year or so unofficially he had more than enough money to pay for rent at our old place so he did i was sort of in between my parents home and his apartment now my name is just as much part of the lease as his all of my things are at this new apartment and i hate it every single time i leave my parents house i just sit in the driveway and cry i rushed too quickly to be out of high school and in college with all my freedom my downward spiral started when i wasnt accepted to my dream school uga i had always said id go there from the time i went to games and tailgated with my uncle and dad as a kid but even with honors grad a few ap classes and a decent gpa and act score i wasnt accepted i graduated high school with a 38 gpa and honors i skipped classes nearly every day i never did my work but it never mattered because i always had as college was obviously different but i still skipped because my teachers never really did anything about it i managed to end the semester with a 30 gpa my only failed class being an annoying college 101 required course i decided then that i wanted more freedom to work and all that so i applied to liberty university online my parents alma mater it severely kicked my ass and i failed both classes on account of not doing any work nowi amhere i am trying desperately to start back at a tech school in january and try to transfer into uga but life just keeps kicking my ass i cant get a job despite having great experience and references and i havent even begun on my relationshipmy boyfriend and i met on tinder in august of 2015 i just went through a horrible breakup with my high school boyfriend of 25 years who thought it would be fine to break up with me via email while i was in scotland on a school exchange trip my boyfriend who well call john also went though a breakup a few months prior to mine we met up and talked and eventually started dating but hes now an entirely different person than i met i know i am too because people change but hes too different all he does is play video games all day i love video games and i even love playing them for hours but when it becomes the first thing you do when you get out of bed at 45pm and dont stop until you go to bed around 56am its a problem hes perfectly content to live in filth he rarely if ever picks up after himself we have sex maybe once a month sometimes every other month i know he isnt cheating on me because hes just that lazy obviously the logical solution is to just leave him ive heard it from anyone ive told but as with all things its not that easy we got a puppy together last year and have already agreed that if we break up hes in a better position to take care of him so 1 i lose my dog hes also horrifically depressed but refuses to go to a doctor or do anything about it and i know that when i leave him hes just going to become some shadow of a person and thats not good for the dog or anyone else i know its not my responsibility what he does after we break up but still all of my things are at this new apartment i dont even know how i would begin moving everything back to my parents housei amhorrifically out of shape and thats mostly due to the fact that my boyfriend is obviously too lazy to cook every day so he normally just orders food 2x a day weve somehow spent 40000 since january and i dont know how no extravagant purchases no vacations just a bunch of small meaningless purchases that add uptldr i dont know what to do i feel so stuck and my heart hurts ive fucked up my life i have no passions i cant get a job i cant go to my dream school my relationship is terrible i owe 500 i dont have and i want nothing more than to just stop existing

1,interesting ive never blogged before or been on a forum but its become to much ive tried many times clearly unsuccessfully ive even went as far as charcoal burning for the carbon poison but couldnt stand the smoke even though i took a shitload of alprazolam to go to sleep so ive done a lot of research on lidocaine and intravenous ive managed to take my own blood and although i know the heart attack isnt the most pleasant way to go it isnt the worst way to go then i will probably slip into a coma beforehand anyway ive done extensive research and ive obtained enough lidocaine to make it happen ironically i went to the er the other day i willinois masonic and the intake nurse violently probed me to get blood she failed i laughed to myself thinking i did a much better job
1,am going to kill myself you dont have to i m posting this here because i have no one to talk to that is by design i have avoidant personality disorder and my version of it is very effective and efficient i don t know anyone i isolate myself because i m ashamed i exist i was an abused and neglected child i never received treatment when it might have helped the person that abused me hid it very well and the other adults in my small family were incompetent and inactivei started fantasizing about suicide when i was 10 this was triggered by circumstance not biology i didn t tell anyone because it would have resulted in violence and mockery i have always been desperate for life to endi tried to kill myself as a teenager but it was a weak effort and i spent a few months in a locked psychiatric ward after i got out i went to school for a while then i just stayed home i lived as a shutin for over a decade spanning my adolescence and early adulthood it was allowed i was sick but no one intervenedi tried to kill myself again this time violently again failure only a month in a psych ward this time when i got out i got my ged and a job i tried to pursue normalcy for a few years but failed i have never felt comfortable around other people my brain malfunctions it feels wrong to be looked at it feels wrong to communicate i m ashamed and embarrassed that i existi was left alone with my mother as a child she was mentally i will emotionally disturbed overwhelmed and unmedicated she wanted to pretend she was alone she would beat me belittle me and torture me in the hopes of keeping me quiet i can still see the rage and hatred in her eyes the disdain and contempt in her voiceshe won i ve spent my entire life trying to pretend i m not here i wanted to love to be affectionate to be outgoing but i don t want to bother anyone i don t deserve anythingi m not dangerous i ve never hurt anyone and have no desire to that s the worst part i m weird and i know people identify me as weird when youre a man and people identify you as weird they fear you i understand its best to err on the side of caution but people being afraid of me or thinking i m potentially dangerous breaks my hearti m going to kill myself the way i see it i have 2 choices isolation or death i can no longer maintain isolation i m out of resources so death it isto make sure it gets done this time i have 2 options if the first is too hard the second only requires a moment of bravery it s violent but guaranteed neither option has the potential to harm anyone elsei m not here for sympathy just to be heard for a moment and to let the younger people here know that the sooner you get help the better your chances of recovery if you can ask for help do so i don t have it in me but i wish i didjust remember there is no cure for mental i willness but there are people that can teach you tools and skills that will help you manage it and gain controli m going to die because i see no other choice if you do see choices please make the choice that allows for a better and longer lifei love youthank you for readingtldr i ll be dead soon do better than me taker easy
1,i wouldnt be doing this for myself recently ive been falling back into a depression again ive been clinically diagnosed with depression for about two years now and as you may know it doesnt really ever go away it just sort of subsides i think this is due to all the returning stress in my life with the returning school yeari amonce again going to high school my high school is a special high school in a sense that its especially bad other schools threaten their students with the prospect of going there and its not even an alternative school we consistently are beaten by all the other schools in every academic area and the majority of our teachers have stopped caring this sense of apathy has spread to lots of the intelligent students causing a chicken in the egg conundrumwith my return to my school people have started questioning me about what i want to do with my life typically i just shrug and say i dont know but truthfully i really like art it is my dream to write andor animate a television show but sadly where i live the only job prospects are meth manufacturer and meth dealer this brings me to another problem money my family is pretty poor i live in a one parent home with two siblings one of which is very sick and may very likely die soon my father has also told me that his doctor had told him that he wont live past 60 he is in his mid fiftiesthankfully however my family has saved enough for college sadly we can only afford a bachelors degree for both my surviving sibling and imy plan is to kill myself sometime soon or at least before graduation so that my brother will have enough for a masters degree and then some i genuinely dont see the bad side to this i may even be able to make it seem like an accident so that he doesnt have to deal with the grief of having a brother for a suicide case if i cant make it an accident i definitely wont bring this whole scheme up in the note thats just poor mannersin a sense id really be killing two birds with one stone here id be giving my brother a better life one that he deserves and id be able to die happily knowing that he got out of this shitty situation 
1,is it too late to excel at 24 i know this question probably gets asked a lot but i also see many misleading answers to this question most of the time the answer is no look at person x he didnt start the thing he good really good at till he was 30 or no most nobel prize winners make their huge discoveries around 40 but what is wrong with these arguments is that these people didnt really dwell in depression till that age they built the foundation for their success till then or learning other things and how to learn things or at least not getting brain damage i was shit at uni due to laziness and depression and social anxiety i really think now i am doomed to live the like of a dumb person and that i wasted my potential forever that i cannot be great at socializing anymore just less shit and this thought really makes me want to kill myself 
1,i thinki amabout to diei am16 young and naive this all just feels so empty typing this now please dont perceive this as a cry for attention i just need a little advice i used to care about school up until about halfway through last year i got concussed cant play hockey anymore my grades fell to shit now i go to school high fuck off in class and just dont care all the girls i meet are likely scared away by my distant and cold behaviour and the ones that arent just want some stoner boyfriend nobody chooses to love me and ive only just realized this my parents hardly talk to me just becausei am not religious and they found that out they support my criminal of an older brother more than they give a shit about me my friends are fake they hardly talk to me and i know they wouldnt talk to me once highschool is over if i make it anyways i thinki am going to die i keep finding myself in these absolutely fucking crazy situations i climbed a train bridge to take a picture of my shitty city in the dark cold night ive been on countless police chases i like to ride an unregistered motorcycle i love running from the cops even while high climbing into abandoned buildings i even went into an abandoned military base with armed guards a few weeks back just stupid shit like that and i am not afraid of dying speeding through the city at 4am at twice the legal speed limit i just dont really care anymore nothings keeping me here how can i make myself care again feeling empty isnt the greatest thing especially when it draws you to death 
1,no one to talk to if there was one i would be too anxious and get a panic attack i cant even see therapists anymore my anxiety and depressions got so bad i cant talk to anyone anymore also i ruined my last friendship just now so i cancelled every therapist appointment i would have gone to just for my friend all motivation is gone and the suicide thoughts never were so damn reali amjust so hopeless crying all day in my dark appartment no friends family or job also my savings will be gone very soon and i end up on the streets its sad that death seems like the only logical option to me i am so lonely it has become physical pain i dont know what to do i have no one

1,what am i supposed to do ive dealt with depression for most of my life and never before did i think killing myself was okay i never considered it nowi amthinking about it all the time a few weeks ago i went to the emergency room i didnt have a specific plan so they referred me to a day treatment program i spent 3 weeks thereim not betteri amprobably worse now because it feels like ive exhausted my options therapy hasnt helped my medication isnt helping not enough at least spending 6 hours a day in the hospital didnt help the only other option seems like inpatient but i heard nothing but horror stories from the people in my program i dont want to end my life but i dont know how to stop the thoughts no one can tell me and i feel like at some point i just wont have the strength to fight it anymoreevery time these feelings come upi amresearching a little more putting my affairs in order each time feels like it could be the last

1,dont see the point anymore 16 years old just started 6th form at school i will be honest i just dont really see the point anymore ive been a music and academic scholar for 3 years now coming onto 4 and the demands on my time are ridiculous its a boarding school so they can pretty much do with my time as they pleasei amtaking physics chemistry maths and further maths all subjects that i enjoy but i amdefinitely struggling to keep up with the work load for the past 3 years my extra curricular activities have so far been rugby and thats about it in 6th form you get to do a race called the devises to westminster race which is an incredibly long kayaking race in england takes a few terms of dedicated training to get to the required skill level but its an incredible experience had my first on water session today and due to a minibus breaking down on the way back from the riveri amabout 30 minutes late for a termly music scholar meeting i go to see the head of music to apologise and i try to explain what happened but he just shrugs and says its always this and that never your fault i am not performing the rolesi amexpected to as a scholar now fine i understand where hes coming from asi amsaving 15 of a 30k yearly tuition from this scholarship so obviously they expect something in return he asked me after the bollocking whether i wanted to be a scholar he said he was more than happy to phone my parents and tell them i was no longer a music scholar i said of course not i want to be a scholar however thats just a lie i hate being a music scholar being an academic scholar is fine as they only have weekly lectures but when the time i have to catch up on work my free periods my free time before and after breakfast and supper and occasionally my weekends are taken up by this musical demand i just cant take it anymore i just want to be able to spend an afternoon with my friends but instead i have daily music rehearsals for a handful of groups and instrumental lessons where i learn nothing now with this added work and all the additional work i need to do for further maths i feel i cant anything my parents have asked me whether i really want to be a music scholar and i feel like i have to say yes the tuition fees are 30k a year so with 15 off for music and 15 off for academic scholarships on top of a 35 bursary were already being given huge savings on tuition i dont know much about my parents financial situation but i know enough to know that i would not be able to stay at this school if i lost my music scholarshipi amsure we could amass the money somehow but with my dad having recently retired i just cant make them do that so if i stopped id have to change schools right at the start of one of the hardest couple of years in my education ive been here for 4 years now and i see it as my home away from home i know everyone i know all the teachers and i have become close with lots of people i cant leave now i just feel like everything would be so much easier if i just ceased to live i dont understand whyi ameven trying to live through this and it just strikes me as such a clear option its about the only thing i can think of that can solve this i dont want to have to wake up every morning to take part of a routine i hate it would be so much simpler to not wake up knowing i now cant go kayaking the only request ive made is the final straw if i cant even do one thing that isnt music or just a standard compulsory sport i just dont want to do anything i cant do climbing i cant play golf i cant go swimming i cant do anything all of my peers are spending their time doingi amjust rambling now but it really makes me sad my sister had depression and my parents had to deal with that and they were fine they understood what she was going through and she understood that selfharm was her coping mechanism i feel that theyd learn to understand the choices id made and i think that makes me feel less of a coward well thats it
1,forgiving oneself doesnt make sense to me i just dont understand why it would be acceptable morally to forgive myself for things ive done or said the only thing ive heard is that its practical and you cant move on with life unless you have but it being practical doesnt make it right why would i deserve to move on worse though my self hatred is more just a way to not feel so bad about being stuck in the past idki am not too commuted to this post i just havent talked to anyone in a really long time

1,what am i doing to myself i just recently graduated college and have an education degree i have my initial teaching certificate but i am not using it i hate seeing teachers treat students simply like some robots that need to be able to pass tests so i doubt that my coworkers would understand my priority to make students independent thinkers rather than treat teaching as some job with shallow requirements i fear of being alone in my career so i dont pursue it i know its selfish i should work for my studentsi dont want to tell my family or my two friends about my loneliness because they would include me more because of my selfishness rather than becausei ama good man nor do i want to scare them yet i do want to be closer with my friends and family but i know that they dont want to becausei amboring awkward and take everything seriously who the hell wants to hang out with someone like that i dont blame them so instead ive been working 75 hours a week the past couple months at two parttime jobs not to make ends meet but to distract myself from my loneliness the simpleminded endless work keeps my mind busy during the day and helps me fall asleep at nighti was just offered a teaching job at the number 1 school in the county since their math teacher was fired midway due to some extenuating circumstancesi am going to see the school in a couple days but i want to turn it down i just want to push my two friends and family away ignore them and just workbecause downtime alone makes me hate my damned boring self and working at schools has made me depressed from seeing how much some poor teachers have hurt these students and from how much more i could have done for themi dont want to be alone but i dont want to bother my family and friends even morei amjust moving in some direction wanting to give up every step of the waywhat am i doing to myself

1,do i need to clickbait about how much i want it to endi amgonna start this of with background i am a sixteen year old male who lives in the uk i have now ceased having contact with my whateveritscalled at a childrens hospital due to my age and cahms would not have me as my case was not severe enough aka i havent attempted yet this is because just like in america depression is an epidemic so i understand they cant help everyone i recently changed school i left behind my peers by my own choice i choose to change schools so that i could attempt year 10 again i spent this year not doing a lot as i struggle with motivation i was working in a separte unit and didnt do much work every day was a struggle so i made a change if i hadnt changed school i would have killed myself by now purely because i felt stuck like death was the only way out new school is as supportive as it can bemy new school only has 70 students at once class sizes are 6 pupils max and i still struggle to stay in lessons this new school is a specialist school not special as in catering for children that are in wheelchairs specialist means they have specially trained staff to deal with asd autism spectrum disorder you have to have asd to get in to the school so yes i am autistici only found out i am autistic like a year ago so i still havent quite come to terms with it my older brother is also autistic i share a room with him always have since i was born this is the first problem i have nothing against people with autism but it does mean they are harder to be around this makes forming new relationships near impossible at school because my peers do not like change i am a change i am surrounded from autistic people wherever i am home or school it makes me have to think twice about anything i say or do since everyone is so sensitiveautistic people claim to want to die a lot every other day someone screams it down the corridor or says it under their breath in class many of these claims arent due to depression this is their reply when something isnt going their way and they want it to stop but they dont know how to stop it this doesnt make it anyless taxing mentally hearing young kids say they want to die so frequently can take a toll on you as a person a large part of my anxiety and the moment stems from being in year 11 for the second time year 10 attempt to feels like a waste of time when i look back all my old friends who dont want anything to to with me purely becausei am not easy to have as a friend now are off going to college and getting apprenticeships seeing all their prom photos and how happy they look makes me sad so i deleted social media i am in the same spot i was last year isolated and not communicating with anyone i barely do any work due to the fact it all feels degrading at this school i was predicted a at my last school because i havent done any work and swapped schoolsi ampredicted for ds nowi have tourettes i only get physical ticks but no vocal this affects my communication as it gets worst wheni amstressed or self conscious my body jerking around does impede on my speech at times which makes speaking in front of even one person a chorei share my classes with kids the same age as my little sister can you imagine how that feels to have a younger sibling catch up to you its feels crapi had a accident on a school trip when i was younger and spent 16 months in a backbrace i was about 12 i dont want anyone else to go through that at that youngi know my problems seem small compared to kids in africa or other ops on this subreddit but that doesnt make me feel less crap in fact it makes me feel worse angry at myselfwhen i am angry at myself i break things throw things and punch walls childish i know i have always had a short temper this lead me to my first suspension when i was in my old school just because some kids where throwing pens at my back which of course is a trigger for me i stood up and punched one so hard in the face he fell of his chair i feel bad he was only doing it due to peer pressure my squeaky clean record tarnished and the other kids didnt get in trouble because the teacher was oblivious and no children advocated for meim done ranting sorry if it looks bad but i dont exactly care

1,i dont know how i can get help sorry if this is hard to make sense of i feel like i dont know anything anymore i was 8 years old when my parents got divorced from then on until i turned 13 and had the courage to not go back to my fathers house i was physically abused half the time i was there always for no real reason i found out that he was into bdsm shit like that and i dont know what to think of those years now knowing this anyways all i can remember from my childhood is traumatizing shit and the stuff that isnt i dont even know if it actually happened or its just a dream or my head just making shit upi amyoung i guess still in highschool 10th grade last year was horrible i would be crying every other day in class just from not knowing anything and from what i would think others would think of me i changed schools after first semester didnt show up for almost 3 months and failed all but 1 class i wasnt in a good place constant delusions couldnt justify keeping up with basic hygiene unless i had to see someone who probably knew me because i didnt want anyone judging me for any reason one of the nurses or whoever at the second school brought something up which led to me having a panic attack to them calling my mother and practically forcing me to admit what happened back then my mother didnt care about it assuming it was just nothing and proceeded to yell at me over failing classes i had one close friend then a couple others who id talk with on a regular basis but i recently moved almost 900 miles away and i can feel that the internet wont keep those friendships together i have no friends at my current school and since ive been here we have only had enough money to get by everyone else here isnt like that i feel scared to say anything at my school since there are papers hung all over the place about suicide and i heard a classmate talking about how shes going to report another girl at my school because of her being depressed and i feel like i cant say anything to my mother or her fiance because i feel like theyd just tell me to get over this i tried talking to two of my old friends 900 miles away about a little bit of how ive been feelingthinking and the only response i got was thati amcrazy since february ive gone pretty much every day just overall thinking of suicide and simply not being here i dont see any point in living besides i dont want to possibly hurt anyone because of it in the future i would attempt to get help if i could but i dont know how ps mentioning that others have it worse doesnt help sorry again for my shitty writing there is other things going on with me but i dont feel like mentioning it because i just dont know how to word it 
1,ampathetic i know this is going to sound overly dramatic but as someone who has considered suicide since they were 8 years old i jump to dramatic conclusions quickly ive been in college for approximately 2 weeks now and ive realized what a piece of fucking lower middle class garbage i am compared to everyone else i come from a state in the tristate area and moved to ny manhattan specifically for college living in the dorms wherei amfrom there is no opportunity for someone like me because i am a creative and if you werent a family friend of some rich italian family who owned a pizza restaurant in my old town then you were shit out of luck for any opportunity now i go to an art school because believe mei am not capable of doing anything else i am fucking stupid and yes its expensive to be here and yes i got a significant amount of financial aid and yes its still a lot of money when i moved here i didnt come with that much money ive been very good at limiting what i spend i only spend money on what i absolutely need on top of college being a lot of money everything here is also more costly so money goes quick even if its only on essentials started my painting class yesterday and got handed out the long ass materials list and knew off the bat i couldnt afford all of this my class is full of wealthy exchange students who went out and bought everything on the list without any worry of financial stability during our break time i spent 6 hours in that fucking studio class thinking about howi am going to get all this shit and afford food at the same time i walked to an art supply store nearby and almost considered stealing some things but i didnt i left empty handed and feeling like shit on top of school materials i am practically wearing the same clothes every week because i have so few ive resisted spending literally anything or going out anywhere if i can help it ive heard a million different things about student loans and all that bullshit and my head still isnt completely wrapped around about what i have to do and where to do it to make my stupid fucking payments dont really want to think about it right now but i will do it anyways my parents are helping me out paying for tuition and shit but other than thati amon my owni am not going to kill myself right away but i would love to open my window and jump from 16 stories down onto the sidewalk and die i am so fucking alone here and so fucking pathetic money doesnt buy happiness but it fucking controls everything that i cant afford fuck college fuck my painting class and fuck my stupid fucking life i should have never been born

1,thoughts on suicidal impulses that arent always associated with actual feelings of sadness despair etci amwondering if anyone else tends to experience this because i havent really seen it discussed anywhere before obviously wheni amexperiencing particularly strong bouts of depression and feeling hopeless i dwell on thoughts of ending my life outside of that the rest of the time though i still have these like impulses or urges that seem completely disconnected from my mood or feelings like walking across a bridge not thinking about anything wrong with my life not experiencing anything that could be related to sadness or unhappiness or anything like that sometimes i can even be really happy or upbeat at the time but i will still feel this strong drive or draw towards the water like a magnetic pull towards the railing i ended up moving residences because i had to walk across a bridge to get to work from my old place and i wasnt sure i could trust myself forever likewise with freeways train platforms the presence of firearms or strong pills stuff like that i become preoccupied with their presence and its hard to concentrate on other things as my mind keeps drifting back towards that opportunity its not like wheni am going through a period of depression where i think about ending my life as an escape or because life isnt worth living or anything like that it almost feels likei amconsidering the act just on its own for no reason at all just to do it just because i can like the urge to scratch a mosquito bite or step on a sidewalk crack does anyone else experience that does anyone know of any literature or anything like that which speaks on it 
1,i hate that feeling you get when you feel worthless and useless i just feel likei ama spectator in this world when i was younger i remember saying to myself that i am a spectator of life that was because i loved listening to other peoples thoughts and their stories but now its still that but in the worse way possibleive started to feel like ive become a worthless and useless human being who is unintelligent and whos only goal in life is too be a spectator of life and never have any worth and meaning i dont have a girlfriend ive never had anyone else care about me aside from my parents and extended family but they are kinda forced to love meno one else has ever cared for me like my family and i just feel likei aminvisible whenever i go outside or wheni amat work or universityi am not very intelligent and i feel inferior compared to everyone else i knowno one will love me and ive tried to kill myself many times but ive never become scared of the idea to do it again i have made many plans and some have fallen through while ive been close to actually ending iti feel weak for not being able to kill myself and i want to do it again and again and again until i finally leave this worldim a worthless and useless human being no one will care for me and even if they said they did they really dont care when i kill myself i will be forgotteni am going to try and call the samaritans in the uk but i doubt it will be much help

1,very long post i might be killing myself in a couple of years i know that you guys might be tired of seeing posts about the same problems all over again but i amfeeling as if i really need to talk to someone who understands how this life works very long post ahead please show mercy to me ive been suicidal for more than 10 years now the first signs of depression appeared at about the same timei am21 now and ive already decided that i wont make it to my thirties considering how problems just keep piling up as you get older in fact i have already tried killing myself by stepping in front of an upcoming train unfortunately i was pulled back by some guy who probably thought id slipped on ice in hindsight i understand how stupidly selfish this was and i feel ashamed understanding how many problems i could create for the engineer and passengersi amthinking of using a more safe method now and ive found a couple already now i just need to put them to test this condition is a result of an extremely lifeworsening combination of things which make me a poor excuse for a human firsti amvery anxious and shy around people i physically cant stand their presence all i want is to sit in a quiet corner with no one to disturb me unfortunately as a college student i must engage in social interactions on an everyday basis and its a kind of torment for me i want to have true friends who would genuinely care about me but i would have nothing to give them in returni amalways sitting alone in quiet contemplation as they speak to each other and laugh and have fun and i amjust there like a monument to eternal sorrow and loneliness like an exile i wouldnt mind having a girlfriend but thats the next partanother problem isi amugly and i mean it not people are closing their eyes in horror scream and run away when they see me kind of ugly but quite close to that logical conclusion my chances of finding a girlfriend are nonexistent ive never been in a relationship i dont know what holding hands with your loved one feels like i havent even been kissed feels likei ammissing out on a very important part of this life but theres nothing i can do about it every time i think i learned to live with that reality reminds me how miserable i am and how easily such misconceptions can be shattered every time i see myself in the mirror i regret not having a gun at least that would spare people on the streets from having to look at this beast without the beauty so many problems could be solved if i had attractive appearance but i am not a lucky person and good looks are not for mei amalways comparing myself to other people and everyone absolutely everyone is better than me with few rare exceptions it doesnt work too good for my selfesteem which went below the core of earth long ago one more reason to end this miserable existencethe third problem is i live in a pisspoor third world country which keeps getting worse every year there is absolutely no chance of me ever leaving it i have very little money and even fewer opportunities to make some i always wanted to see what decent life means how people live in europe and the usa but fate decided that i must rot in my cage without getting out of it sometimes it seems to me that sneaking aboard a freighter going across the atlantic isnt such a bad idea jokes aside ive been thinking of becoming an i willegal immigrant due to how no legal options are available for me but that takes balls of steel and that is something i dont havei am too weak and soft to take any risks the fourth problem is i cant do things well i cant do anything well my only achievement in life was learning the english language which is hardly of any help in my situation there isnt much use to it when youre eternally locked in a country where people hardly know their own language let alone any foreign ones apart from that i havent achieved anything i cant draw i cant write i cant make music i cant do what anyone else around me seems to be able to do with ease crying at nights is something i could master with a little practice but it wouldnt get me anywhere all in all these problems combined make my life very difficulti amsurprised ive lived that long but i have a feeling that its about to end quite sooni ampretty sure someone has been in a similar situation before so i could use some wise words from the sages of this subreddit but without it gets better eventually please it doesnt

1,tomorrow might be the dayi am not 100 yet but i think tomorrow is when i will do it i stayed home from school today because i just couldnt bring my self to go to school and do my work like everything is okay tomorrow i will go i will dress cute look pretty for my final day make sure to hug all the friends i care about for a final goodbye when i get home i will need to write several letters to important family members and certain people in my life if youre wondering whyi am going to kill myself i guess i will tell you why my life was a mess i was doing lots of shit i shouldnt do drugs sleeping around not respecting myself because i was depressed i have diagnosed depression it runs in the fam woohoo but then something changed my dad gave me the option to stay where we were or move to a new state because he had gotten a job offer even though i liked my life at the time because i had a few friends and would party every weekend something inside me told me to move on so i did i came to where i currently live and my life changed so much for the better i had a new better reputation people liked me well a lot of girls were still bitchy thats never changed and i met someone i met him everything about him was perfect and we instantly clicked best friends and lovers he knew everything about my past and the low things i had done and he loved me anyways i knew everything about him too ive never had such an honest and open loving relationship with someone he really was the one as dumb as that may sound to u well this summer something changed and we had a huge fight over something he had done not cheating i was so mad at him and even though i forgave him for months afterward i acted childish always mad over small things always being too overprotective of him we had both always been overprotective of eachother but since then i took it to the extreme and i knew i wasnt behaving the right way but at the time i didnt give a shit because i was still mad at him but that doesnt mean i didnt love him i love him more than anything and we still had tons of happy times but i guess the bad times canceled those out and i guessi am an idiot because i ignored him when he warned me he wasnt happy like this and then last weekend was the breaking point he came back from a trip and told me he wanted to break up he was serious i fought for him and begged him and told him i really would change the way id been acting finally he agreed that while i went out of town the following weekend wed have a mini break he promised to keep an open mind and also stay loyal to me of course some time away from eachother so we didnt call and barely texted and it was the hardest thing ever someone whos been in your life constantly for so long well yesterday i flew back and i had lost hope over the weekend but i didnt let myself feel the pain i told myself not to worry because in 2 days i can just take the pain away forever well yesterday i did something foolish i let hope creep back in i had hope he would listen to me and believe me id change he didnt hes heard it before but i meant it this time i did bc losing him was at stake i tried everything and i spoke to him from my heart and he didnt care he wouldnt do it and i amdevastatedi am so mad at myself for taking him for granted i love him and i am so sorry i wish i could go back in time to take it all back and at this point i dont care anymore i dont want to move on i cant imagine seeing him with anyone else i cant imagine myself talking to anyone else so tomorrows the day i think i just have to pick a sure method either gabapentin od slicing my wrists or a combo of both for sure outcome or jumping off a cliffbuilding congrats if u read my miserable story to the end no advice please i dont care if things get better blah blah i dont carei amdone

1,not sure it will ever go away since i was 14 ive had issues with suicide and depression a lot of that stems from my childhood not the best but maybe a story for later anyways highschool was bad but after highschool was worse i didnt really have the social support structure that i neededi am28 now i still have my battles but it doesnt feel as bad as it once did part of me believes that well never truly be 100 healed i still like to think theres hope though i will say that after fighting the fight for so long it does become tiring almost to the point in which youre ready to throw in the towel once you get over that hill fighting the fight is simpler you can suppress it alot easier its still hard though occasionally i will have a suicidal thought but not as frequently as i once did i have hope 
1,amjust tired its long past time for me to go my whole life has been little more than sadness misery and pain i have no hope that itll be any better tomorrow only worse my mind is broken from untreatable mental i willness my body is breaking down from stress perpetual suffering and my crummy job my soul is long gone everyday is bad alone isolated just waiting for my pitiful excuse for an existence to endi am tiredi amjust plain tired life was never meant for me i would have been better off having never been conceived its time for me to leave this world leave this life at last i already have a method in mind all it needs now is its final preparations i thinki amready
1,constant physical pain i just want it to end i have a disease called interstitial cystitis its a bladder disease that makes you feel like you have a constant uti except theres no infection and no curei am in constant pain every second of the day ive tried every treatment that five different doctors have thrown at me and nothing has helped i have to stick to an incredibly limited diet or the pain becomes excruciating anything that tastes good is off limits nothing but really bland meats and grains and vegetables no seasoning most fruit is bad no chocolate no coffee no alcohol no acidic food of any kind acid is basically what gives food flavor i cant have sex because it makes the pain worse and that part of my body always hurts at what point does life just not become worth living i feel like ive hit that point i wish assisted suicide for chronic pain was legal in the us i would try to do it myself but i am too afraid of failing 
1,i feel likei amdrowning i just got rejected after my fourth job interview ive been searching and unemployed for a month stuck in a house with emotionally abusive and controlling parents desperate to make some money and leave but i canti dont know what i even want out of life anymore i have no aspirations and my self confidence is completely shot i have no friends either never have never will i really dont want to kill myself because i am too scared i also think i still love my parents and my brother who constantly berates me and blames me for arguing with my parents instead of being completely obedient like him and dont think i can do this to them by taking my own life but the longer i live the more i see no way out of this pain i sometimes think i was just meant to eventually do it cuz i am a waste of effort and resources on my parents maybei am too stupid to realize that yet anyways thank you all for listening
1,i really need help but dont know what to do i was suicidal in high school went through therapy got pilled up and felt worse for it all they made me feel was numb and alone at the same time i felt like a third person watching myself live life when i went away to college i started feeling better i met a girl that showed me happiness was possible and it was the first time in my life i felt genuinely loved by someone because of who i was as an individual and not because of relation that joy was fleeting though shortly after being together the depression came back but i wasnt suicidal anymore flash forward years later and the suicidal tendencies and thoughts crept back into my head two months ago she realized she couldnt deal with it anymore after 45 years together and broke up with me now i feel all alone the only person that could pull me out of my worst spots is gone she was also the one that would push me to do something with myself when i felt helpless and would try as hard as possible to make me happy even if it was just for a moment she was my best friend and my lover in one i always told her she was the best thing that ever happened to me and would try as hard as i could to make her feel appreciated but now weeks after our breakup i still keep in contact with her but she said she only ever feels sad when she sees me that coupled with the rumors i hear about what shes doing nowadays hurts so i dont know if talking to her is a good idea anymore i love her still and i feel my best talking to her but i cant bear the impact i have on her and how i feel afterward she isnt the source of the depression nor is she the source of these tendencies i have i just felt like sharing that because now i dont know who i can lean on and what to do for myself i want to get better but i fear that its too late for me i really just want someone to talk to and lean on ive been so panicky anxious stressed and lonely what freaks me out the most is that thinking about suicide is the only thing that relaxes me it helps me stop thinking about whats wrong in my life and how i feel its the only way i fall asleep at night please help reddit any advice is more than welcome and feel free to pm me

1,idk what to do anymore sorry for the long post i just typed what came to mind i m currently 23 and a half years old living in the netherlands when i was 16 i was diagnosed with high sensitivity and depression things that happen hit harder and stick longer in my brain both positively and negatively mostly the negative things though since my 16th birthday i ve had a psychologisti know right lovely birthday present until last year when i thought i had my life under control but apparently i ve just hit rock bottom when i was 15 i had my first girlfriend she had some problems of her own but i didn t think much about it because at that time i was busier with getting bullied and sitting behind my computer playing video games couple of months later she moved in with me and my mother i don t really know the reason anymore but there were some problems at her home it seemed like a good idea and it was kind of enjoyable for the first couple of weeks we shared a room and you know were teenagers raging with hormones after the said couple of weeks i kind of lost interest in the sexual things but still loved her nonetheless she began to change waking me up with sex while i didn t feel like it but i couldn t say anything about it because i thought it was normal my daily life consisted of waking up playing video games going to school coming back home and eating dinner crawl behind the computer chit chat with my ex talkingwatching tv if she wanted to do something or almost fall asleep behind the computer and go to bed occasionally someone that i knew messaged me or dragged me out of the house to get something to drink the owner of the caf she took me to knew my family so sometimes he would give me a couple of beers got a little out of my shell and went back home again every time i started talking to my ex that i wasn t feeling very happy and that i needed time for myself she threatened to commit suicide so i kept quiet my ex began to change again more sex i couldn t talk to people anymore she even got pissed at me when i talked to other people or even my mom didn t really know how to deal with it all around that time but i kind of held onto her annoyances and got annoyed as well due to my high sensitivity people around me couldn t see it but it was chipping away on the inside bullying continued at school and even at home i wouldn t feel comfortable anymore months later i snapped and ended up in some youth prison i blacked out broke a couple of windows and screamed at people and threatened my sister and my mother when it all happened when i try to remember it all again it s all foggy and i get a massive headache even to this day after a couple of weeks in youth prison i decided i had to get rid of my ex because she was negatively impacting my life i didn t care about her life anymore because i needed to fix my stuff first if i wanted to continue living she agreed packed her stuff and two days later had a new boyfriend i got over it but my daily life continued with gaming school and my courtassigned psychologist i discovered that i was depressed didn t see life in colors i couldn t care less about the people around me and didn t even feel a connection with my family members no bond or anything as far as i was concerned i was living with strangers i got antidepressants after the first couple of talks and the dosage increased more and more after every couple of talks i had no will to live no reason to be alive i was just a small dot on a piece of paper after a lot of talks i kinda felt better i was getting good at some videogames and even ended up having a lan party and actually winning it felt really good to achieve something even though it felt i wasn t even that good i felt as if my team won and i was unnecessary i still put on a happy face for my team and the pictures that were getting taken but it wasn t me that helped the team to the first place it was the other four i started studying application developer not really having any clue why but it made me sit behind a computer the entire day and i learned new things so i couldn t complain it was a 4 year course but in my second year i lost interest and motivation again every teacher and fellow student told me i breezed through the classes and i could pick up things in an incredible pace but i couldn t get out of bed never hungry or felt the need to eat and i d cry myself to sleep for some reason i was still unhappy my psychologist called the school and talked to their therapist to set up a meeting with me to talk me through my issues so i could get my motivation back and continue because i was already halfway it didn t work out and i redid my 2nd year no luck felt even worse didn t make it my school talked me into downgrading the level so instead of an application developer i started studying to become an it guy all my older classmates finished school and i barely made it through the entrylevel course i started doing different kinds of work to get money slowly things looked a little brighter i had money i could do things myself i wasn t that much dependent on my mother and stepdad anymore and i even got lighter antidepressants i met a girl on someone else s birthday party a couple of months later and when i was intoxicated enough we made out and started hanging out we had a good thing going every weekend i went to her parents place to play videogames and talk about difficult things she had a lower back hernia and in secret i tried learning to give lowerback massages to people with hernias to relieve their pain a little but sadly i took over the negative trait of being to clingy from my previous ex and destroyed the only good thing i had in life i was devastated back to square minus 50 i started getting suicidal and they upped my meds again tried committing suicide 4 times and even when i almost jumped in front of a train someone pulled me off and not because he was a good person but because he didn t want to be late for work talk about a finishing blow i went back to focusing on work and getting money and years later i met someone else at the same job in that year my meds were taken away and i could handle it on my own we started dating and the talks with my psychologist ended it felt natural and trusting so i ended up opening up to her couple months later we had our own place and she became my reason and motivation to work 5 days a week and earn money to provide a month ago we had our 1 year anniversary last week i had 2 more hours to go at work and i received a text saying she took all her stuff and she was gone she didn t feel anything for me anymore and that she was sorry i m home alone now for a week over the years i learned to be composed and to calm myself but i m cracking open and i don t know what to do anymore i m at the end of my train of througts videogames sports or music don t keep my mind off my depression anymore and i m losing it i don t know what to do or where to go but i know the depression just climbed all the way back and everything around me is back to grey i m trying to put my mask on to continue working but i can t anymore i need advice _
1,am in constant physical pain from stress ptsd actually cptsdi have tried everything but the physical pain is so overwhelming it always comes back no matter what it permeates my arms legs face neck torso everything every cell in my body is usually in so much pain i cant handle it anymorewhats more is i have constantly been psychologically fucked up for the nearly 21 years of my life i have never known happiness or togetherness with people who value me i have no idea what that is like i dont know what love is i cant keep going i have so much pain in me and theres no solution
1,i dont believe that doctors actually want to help if they did they would help people like me the ones who are truly lost end their suffering would be helpful
1,the world doesn t have anything to offer me life is entirely meaningless if you have to spend it entirely alone i had a 6year relationship fall apart last year because of my severe depression i just kinda let him walk away because i thought our relationship which was codependent and often involved his emotional and sometimes physical abuse of me was destructive and could never make me happy like it used to and for a while i was relieved to be without him and hopeful for the future i met someone new and started this promising new relationship that didn t replicate any of the problems of the last one and was happier and more productive than i had been in years i was sure i d made the right decision and that i d gone through hell in that last relationship just to meet this new guy six weeks ago he walked away too dumping me with a text message and claiming it didn t feel right to him he must have realised how worthless and intrinsically unlovable i am i m simply ineligible for relationships i m too ugly no you re not everyone says and yes i fucking am i ll preemptively cut off that derailing by giving you proof and broken my longterm ex has moved on to a fantastic fulfilling relationship and i m stranded alone forever and consumed with jealousy that he gets to be happy so who was the defective one in that relationship the guy who immediately meets a new girlfriend or the girl who gets dumped again and spends the next 50 years completely alone and i will be alone this is also not up for debate because i m a 210 because i m shit at dating because i spent most of my 20s in a longterm relationship and have bpd so i m either immediately infatuated with someone or don t give a fuck about him there s no in between and because the only person i m attracted to is my recent ex because i m highly disposable because no one who had a choice would ever choose me i don t even choose me there are a few things in my life outsiders would think are good i own a flat i live in a great city i m reasonably successful but i ve realised it s all meaningless if you can t share it if you ve been exiled from the world of love and companionship and forced to watch everyone enjoy the things you don t deserve and i have to know that it s all my fault because i wasn t content in my longterm relationship because i had the hubris to think that i deserved better when really i was so lucky anyone loved me because i somehow managed to destroy my next relationship and transform his feelings for me into apathy although i was so careful to make sure he never knew about my depression and tried so hard to be perfect and worthy of him because i was born hideousthe world can t offer me anything that even remotely compares to what i ve lost therapy and medication both of which i m getting cannot magically make me worthy of love cannot bring people back into my life cannot give me a future cannot make me attractive that s all immutable and i can never be happy alone not once i learned what i was missing the only way out is to kill myself but right now i m too much of a coward to do it too afraid of messing it up and i really need to do it sooner rather than later if only to spare my family and friends the misery and stress of dealing with me my mother keeps telling me i m going to give her a heart attack because of my various crises and hospitalisations i sometimes can t believe i have the gall to keep breathing when i have been shown so many times that i m just a burden on people that people will never love me that i will never again have a shred of happiness i ve stuck postin notes all over my house telling me to suck it up and do it just endure a little pain for quiet and relief but i m still here like a moron tldr i m too worthless and ugly to be loved and to be alive

1,amhonestly so lost so i dont know what i should do anymore ive attempted suicide before multiple times reaching out to my mom was the first thing i did after my first attempt failed this was in middle school i called her told her what i did and she picked me up and i spent the night with her i was living with my dad at the time since my parents were spliti am not really sure what happend to cause me to become so suicidal and i mightve forgotten at this point honestly but its turned my life into a downward spiral once i entered middle school i completely started skipping class i would sleep through them or skip this continued until once again at the end of my middle school life i attempted suicide this was the first time i had to be hospitalized for it and once again i asked for help and ended up at a therapist talking to him i lied constantly lied lied and lied this was well how i was raised by my mom i dont know if she was embarrassed of me or what but when she got remarried she had me constantly lie to the guy this started up even more once i started high schooli have 2 siblings one older and one younger sister their treatment is 200x better than me throughout my freshman year of high school i always slept on the floor in our house we had a spare room but my mom made me sleep on the floor still i really dont know why my older sister would let me sleep in her bed sometimes but not always in my second year i got a laptop this is when i started playing games to keep my mind of suicide i honestly couldnt take my life at this point i would constantly read books from the library during class resulting in extremely poor grades but i didnt care to me i always felt worthless anyways only my 2 sisters were meant to be anything i was always going to be trash my mom would make sure to always compare me to my older sister i hated it so much but always i would bottle it up never say anything my second year of high school i dropped out since then ive done everything i could to just find something interesting to keep myself happy even the smallest thing whenever my mom tells me something id just bottle it up and turn away ive only ever gotten angry and yelled twice once in elementary and another last week when i just couldnt take it anymoremy mother constantly has me lying to friends and family telling themi am in college or doing well i cant take this anymore i dont even know if i can try to pick up my life at this point i honestly am just thinking of grabbing the gun in our house and ending it all ive never had any friends to talk to the only person i could talk to was my mother and she didnt help when i reached out to her i just dont know what to do anymore
1,can i talk with someone sorry for ask this but unfortunately i have no one to talk about this i just want to clarify somethings before commit suicide
1,fetish about death suicidal but not depressed someone please help me diagnoseunderstand myself betterwhen i was young i remember being constantly suicidal back then it was definitely due to depression growing up i was a younger sibling who felt like my parents would only lovecare for my older sibling and didnt like me much they had us at a young age early 20s and she was a prodigyexcelled at school and everything she did while i was didnt even speak until i was 5 i understood language but intentionally didnt verbally communicate so they thought i was mentally slow if an argument ensued between me and my sister then regardless of whoever is right they would take her side and scold me it was obvious to everyone that they wished my sister was the guy due to hypertraditional values and only kept me around the house because i was the one born with a penistheni am not sure exactly when but somewhere in late elementarymiddle school the beating started i was physically disciplined and scolded before apparently they hit me since i was 1 but i amtalking about beatings i dont think i had it as bad as some others for it was never done under alcoholicsubstance rage by my father and i never felt my life threatened but damn those were not pretty days hell call the school to say that i wont be coming in the next day and go at it his courtesy was allowing me to wear long pants before the session began put me in a push up position and beat me with either a hockey stick wooden baseball bat or a golf practice clubsometimes hed let me choose these sessions werent too often but more often than not it would go on until i wasnt able to walk for the next following days sometimes i was actually guilty of what he was accusing but sometimes i wasnt and that drove me mad for no amount of pleading and reasoning worked with him its also why i dont blame my mother as much she was married to him i can only imagine but he never laid a single finger on my mother or sister but countless days went by with me on the floor crying like a maniac envisioning the day that he would diethen there was the eating disorder this mostly had to do with my selfconfidence i suppose but i became bulimic around then as well and threw up after every meal it wasnt because i didnt like food trust me it was pretty much the only thing that kept me alive in fact i remember loving eating so much that i thought i live to eat and literally only threw up just so i could eat more kinda like how the romans used to do but all this made me really overweight and i reached 210pounds by the end of 8th grade but throughout all the time i hated being fat my family made fun of me in public i knew i didnt look good and would grab on my flabby stomach and cry in the showerso this was around when late elementary around 9th grade i was definitely depressed and suicidal everyday i didnt know i was depressed back then because i simply didnt grasp the concept but it was bad where i was didnt have guns so id always grab a kitchen knife when everyone was asleep and tried cutting myself here and there but throughout all the years no matter how desperately suicidal i was i could never muster the courage to actually slit my wrists deep enough i was a freaking coward and i even hated myself more for that the one thing i could actually have control over i was too much of a fucking coward to pull through i remember wishing if we were still in the states without a doubt this was already over with with a gun this went on for years on a daily basis and i think thats when it became a part of mefast forwarding to the present i am an excellent student at an well established university i excel at both my studies and at my workplace that my future definitely looks bright despite the current political and economic madness during high school the abuse continued and intensified and my parents marriage fell apart but i found sports that i excelled in lost all my weight and had a great social life finally finding a life for myself out of my housebut when i reached adulthood i noticed that i has a love for knives i love the way they feel how its built how a right one feels so cozy and right against my hands holding onto it definitely helps me sleep and i have no motivation to live more like i dont really care what happens but i wish i died not becausei amdepressed it does come sometimes every now and then but havent really had one since 2015 but for reasons i dont quite understand maybe its because ive come to accept that life is mostly going to be filled with shittier moments than not maybe its the frustration with the human race and all the injustice of the world maybei amjust bored or tired but i believe that death is the ultimate liberator as we are chained on this world in a cycle of paintemporary pleasuresgrieves and sin death is what sets us free i often imaginefeel it as a longseparated lover that i long to embrace her kiss would set me free i think about death like how a starcrossed lover thinks about their significant other maybe today will be the day or perhaps i must wait longer if you read all of that i truly thank you it was long and you probably didnt need that in your life but i am curious and honestly somewhat concerned about my case i know its not normal if anything any type of psychoevaluation is welcomed

1,completely pointless tomorrowi am going to jump off the new river gorge bridge in west virginia life is completely pointless i realized this 4 years ago in 9th grade science class when i was finally freed from my brainwashing very religious mother and the private christian school i went to for the rest of my life the difference between my actual intelligence and my social intelligence nonverbal iq is over 30 iq points i never had any friends and everyone whos known me has always talked to me in the same condescending way you talk to your friends eight year old son my family doesnt give a shit about me my dad used to relieve his anger on me and my sister after work when we were young it didnt usually get physical because i would timidly accept his rage and make myself feel visibly ashamed my mom cried because she felt threatened by his abuse not because we were damaged by it my sister wasis completely narcissistic and took a sadistic joy in hurting me whenever she could and if i ever fought back or if our parents overheard us bickering it would usually come back to me the dynamic changed completely a couple years ago when my family realized i was suicidal my mom actually got emotional because of me and my dad stopped being an asshole my sisters still sociopathicnarcissistic my parents are worried about the social repercussions my death would have on themduring that time i missed most of my highschool though i got my ged despite demonstrating an aptitude for academia in the top 1 of the average senior class via ged benchmarksimulated comparison i still have the communication skills of a five year old and i know i will never be able to harness my potential which isnt even that great in the grand scheme of things when you consider the billions of people alive not that it matters anyways i guessi am somewhat thankful for the trauma i endured at home and school otherwise i may have never been deadened to the point of being self aware theres no point to life time is endless and our years are limited societies rise and fall for no ultimate reason and humanity is progressing towards nothing our perception is only an i willusion of the chemical reactions that grant it and i cant stand the agony of knowing the pointless of my own existence i have no friends only my parents will be directly impacted by my absence and why should i care about them when theyre the reason my life has been so miserable the notion that you get to decide whether other people live or die is completely selfish anyways i know people often say that suicide is a selfish act but the reality is that imposing an unbearably miserable life on someone else for your own satisfaction is selfishill always be an outcast to society and theres no point in contributing when i only get scorn in return but really none of what i said matters anyways tldr life is pointless and so is this post tomorrowi am going to kill myself good night 
1,am too much of a pussy to actually do it no you are too strong and believe in hope to actually isolate yourself and so it

1,amending myself in the basement when my parents go to sleep tonight i just cant take my parents anymore ive been depressed for 5 years due to being heavily abused by another family and my parents just dont take me seriously i think ive done everything in the book to try to get them to notice and talk to me but instead they laugh and say i bitch too muchive also tried to take matters into my own hands and walk 3 miles to the local mental health facility to find out their doors were locked and no one willing to let me in i know the facility doesnt have rave reviews but seriously so much for proclaimed 247 righti dont have any friends irl or online dropped out of high school so i cant talk to anyone there and of course my family doesnt want to jack shiti have everything ready and my parents are in the living room watching a movie ive fed my cats one last time and i thinki amready to go
1,is it normal to be envious of someone who just committed suicide i dont thinki amyour typical depressed person or maybe i am and just dont realize it ive been very depressed since i was about 16i amnow 25 i dont have the support system i wish i did and i dont have the money for a therapist i drink smoke weed and take prescription pills to copei dont buy these things my boyfriend does and i just take them becausei amthe worst person on the planet so i guess i will start with the reasons i thinki am so depressed when i was 16 i had what i thought was the perfect life with the perfect parents until the day my dad left my mom it was totally unwarranted i even remember me and my sisters laughing at him because we thought it was a joke not a joke fast forward to now i found out he had been cheating on my mom for 6 years my mom knew nothing my parents friends decided to leave her in the dark till after the divorce was final being sixteen and going through that was hell for me i remember trying to cut myself but i was too scared to cut too deep all i ended up with were little cat scratches on my wrist real edgy anyways so ive also been in love with someone for eh 9 years the problem being this person lives in a different country he had no intention of moving to the statescant say i blame him and to be honest if i were to move there i dont think he would want a relationship with me even though we talk frequently he tells me loves me from time to time but thats easy to say when you know youll never actually have to deal with the consequences of telling someone that so just about every yeartwo years i skip from relationship to relationship i think so i dont get attached i dk but its really hard on me mentally and its even harder because i dont truly understand why i do itokay so fast forward to last december i found out i was pregnant it was a weird feeling i was so overjoyed i think because i thought it would give me purpose i had just started a new job and didnt want to tell them immediately so i hid it from them it was hard to schedule the necessary appointments that way though one morning i woke up at 3am with horrible cramps i didnt fall back asleep i was getting up and around for work at 6 and i was spotting so i called into work i told them i thought it was an ovarian cyst when i got to the hospital everyone was really nicei think they already knew what was going on fast forward to getting an ultra sound and sitting there waiting 5 hours i found out that the fetus inside me was dead who knows how long i had been carrying that thing inside of me dead they gave me my options and i told them i would think about them make a few calls to my insurance provider and let them know tomorrow they sent me on my way at 6pm that night i had a miscarriage in my bed it was the most painful thing i have ever experienced nowi ampretty traumatized i mentally cant have sex anymore and its been putting a huge strain on my relationshipso i bought a gun my boyfriend thinks its because i want to practice shooting the real reason i bought it was because i figured that would be the easiest way for me to kill myself the problem isi am not afraid of death i could put a gun to my head and pull the trigger right now the other problem is that i am an empath and i know killing myself would hurt a lot of people its not their fault they dont understand how much paini am in ive tried to explain but they just tell me in sad and it will pass or maybe i should get some help well its really fucking difficult to get help wheni ambarely paying my car payment car insurance phone bill and rent plus gas for the hour to and from work ride i have mf so i guess i should explain how my title is involved a few days ago i found out someone i graduated high school with committed suicide my family has known his family forever but we werent ever really friends i found myself crying all day long over this person i was never friends with i realized i was crying because i was envious i wanted the courage he had to go through with it i really dont want to be here anymore but i dont know how to turn my conscience off to go though with iti dont know what to do anymore all i think about is killing myself i want it so bad i dont know if i will ever have the balls to do it or not but thanks for reading anyways and if anyone has any advice or anything to share id love to hear it

1,contemplating more and more everyday know i need help but don t have anyone to talk to senior year has just started i spent the summer completely alone because my friends that i ve had my whole life have grown up to be bullies and druggiesalcoholics i perceive myself as someone who is better than that so i pushes them away but this summer was too hard so i made amends some days are better than others but sometimes they can all be such dicks i know you re thinking just make new friends but really i don t know how and it s senior year i m not going to be seeing anymore of these people soon anyway not wanting the friends i have really fucks me up upstairsi ve grown up a larger kid but since i started drinking with my friends almost a year ago now i ve been gaining weight much more rapidly i can only get into the mindset every once in a while but i loose motivation quickly i m 260 now and over the summer i ve grown stretch marks i feel absolutely disgusting and even than doesn t want me to lose it i try as much as i can to be healthy but i always forget and as i m chowin down i remember and say fuck it not looking healthy as i should i believe has always kept me from a girlfriend i ve had a few flings i guess but after the girl decides it s over every time i realize she was just using me for a tool wether it s money or someone to get affection from i strongly feel that everyone around me or knows me feels like they can use me as a tool but i would prefer to help someone get something they need rather than stand up for myself i ve been told i m a very nice person almost too nice and i see it but like i said i would rather make someone else s day even if it fucks me over in the end that s why i also think my 4 flings haven t ended up in a relationship or anything past 2nd base i think loneliness fucks me up too the final thing i will list is my homefamily situation parents divorced at 4 it was agreed that each parent would get 5050 we switched houses every two days i think that having two homes alone can fuck you up but switching every two days fuck that i have a sister who s two years younger and we did it together we always liked our mom more she was loveable and provided a much more fun laid back living situation but she was stern when she needed to be my dad was more strict but fun in the early years my dad has anger issues and is an alcoholic and likes to yell especially when he s upset but we grew up with it my dad got remarried in 2013 and i disliked her but was afraid to tell him as that is mean to saybacklash from that statement but now all she does is order us around tries to control everything including my mom and is generally bitchy even my dad thinks so it s gotten to the point where i don t talk to her and my dad is too much of an asshole to me and my sister that i can stand so over the summer i stayed with just my mom my dad didn t care because my mom is closer in town and my mom couldn t pay for it she filed a thing to take a look at the child support payment which has been the same since the divorce this friday it was my dads weekend but i didn t want to go out there because i m tired of it so i ignored them until about noon when my dad called my mom and told her to tell me to talk to them i didn t eventually my stepmom blew up at my mom which wasn t right she has nothing to do with this situation i finally told my mom that i want to live with her full time after that my dad showed up and we had a long conversation about it all i felt like shit because we were all fighting and we shouldn t have to in the first place and i wouldn t want my son to do what i did to him he was mad about my mom wanting money and seems like that was the only reason he wanted me to stay out there with him he didn t confirm that i could stay with her but he didn t say no long story long i really hate myself about the whole situation and it s sad among other things i bottle my emotions up and can t handle my stress i m over apologetic i ve had a literal headache since 2015i amonly mediocre at things in life and feel i m getting more dumb everyday i get made fun of by almost everyone and most days i feel like no one actually cares i have reached out to others about this but they literally don t care i don t wanna live past graduation don t know what i would do i ve been thinking of a way i want to do it and just haven t decided i don t know what to do and i had no one to talk to sorry this is all over the place i was trying to think of everything and this definitely isn t everything just the most important to me

1,its morning i just wanted to rant for a momenti want really badly to be more suicidal than i am i feel very overwhelmed in the sense that i feel this badlydont feel like i have anyone to talk to to the point where i would post here but i still dont think i have merited it i dont feel like i deserve an outlet social media isnt fun for me anymore because its just anxiety inducing i dont talk to my friends friends i have never bothered to hang out with because i am afraid i am never comfortablei am not comfortable outside my house but when you get down to it how much potential do i have to feel secure if i am scared and overwhelmed lying in bed with mcdonalds hashbrowns en routei feel disgusting its been a kind of crescendoing feeling that now feels like a shrieking sadness i despise even the way i articulate and speak and write because it feels wrong either in the sense that it feels disingenuous or that its too raw too eager in a cringey pathetic kind of way i havent made any progress in therapy but its my fault i dont have anyone to talk to about being depressed or anxious because its so steeped in self loathing and suicidal thoughts and that scares my parents it makes people angry because they dont understand how i could hate myself but its so deeply ingrained in everything i doi am not good enoughi am too muchi ampathetic and avoiding i am not the adult i should benot the person i should be i hate feeling revolting but more than that i hate the way this repels people i cant validate myself but complementsreassurance from others means nothing to mei am too anxious to call my therapisti amtempted to email but i am so disgusted with myself for being weak and patheticbeing depressed i can talk about anxiety is hard because its harder to pin down why i feel the way i do self loathing is just a no go for me because its like a knife people dont understandsorry for being morose i feel like when i let things boil over venting does more harm than good i think its just becausei am tiredi amhaving a moment but i will be fine i think i hope you all have a nice day

1,what is the best way to kill yourself without upsetting othersi amthinking just telling people your going travelling to some far off place and not sure when you will be able to contact them then go to like south africa and go and fuck about in the jungle could be billed as a tragic accident thoughts tips pointers
1,i drank until i lost consciousness last night with no intention of waking up i was just so desolate and miserable last night i continuously drank straight kraken on a whim until i couldnt stay up just hoping i wouldnt see todayi am going through a lot of shit shit thats been plaguing me most of my adult life the people that raised me are all dead or moved away friendships are fleeting and a relationship is impossible the love of my life doesnt love me back and no one else compares ive been severely depressed for nearly 20 years and i have no motivation to help myself i started selfharming recently and that helps my mind some but doesnt do my body any favorsi had a bad day thursday and when i have a bad day it takes me about a week to get over it it gets worse before it gets better and like a wound the danger ends up being the infection over the wound itself i remember waking up on my keyboard and at some point i moved to the living room while waiting for a text from the girl mentioned before and didnt wake up until morning i dont drink a lot normally so that without any food made my tolerance pretty lowi am not really sure whyi amputting this here i dont expect help nor do i want advice i had a stupid moment and just wanted to share i guess its easy for me to accept death these days because i look at it like i could die now or i could die later the only difference is age thats how it will end no matter what and i amonly getting older every day
1,i just want to be euthanizedi amtrans the world is flooded and burning at the same time the government is actively trying to make our lives impossible and i have severe dysphoria about my body that i cant fixi am too depressed to move the people around me are just irritated by my suffering i wish someone could make me comfortable and help me die in my sleep
1,why is my reflection so painful sometimes i refuse to look in the mirror for days because i hate what i see its not that i just hate my body which i do though its just thati cant look at what i think i am no one wants to hire me ive never been in a relationship because i never thinki amgood enough i dont have anything to offer the world and i amjust a skinny little white boy who cant show his feelings to the world or else he looks like a pussy i can never text or talk to people because i always think theyre seeing me in a negative light because of what i said or did i have friends but i never feel likei ama part of any groupi ama senior in college and am afraid of everything after i graduate whether i will be alone for the rest of my life and have no friends or love these are only some of the thoughts that come into my head when i look at that reflection its too painful to look and i amafraid of that one thought that keeps hiding in the corner waiting to come out it sometimes jumps out and scares but then goes back after a few hours and i can breathe a sigh of relief it still doesnt go away thoughi amterrified of what could happen if it decides to latch on then again life is too painful and i hate my own reflection
1,my boyfriend shot himself after 9 months of ups and downs my boyfriend shot himself i had no social media i didnt talk to no one and i quit my job for him and my 8 year old daughter had no contact with her dad just so we could be happy and so we could form that family that my daughter and me always wanted he had face book instagram whatsapp his friends his job where females work too and he also had contact with his ex for the fact they have a little girl together and i didnt mine cause i trusted him but he didnt trust me at all and his family members and his girlfriend talked trash about me and he believed them soon i came pregnant with my second child it was the happiest day for me cause i thought we gonna be good his going to change but it didnt happen his trust issues where always their i didnt now what else to do to make him happy or to be ok with him i try everything i could but nothing work he didnt trust me at all on april of this year he punch me in the face for not having facebook thats crazy right and it wasnt the first time he had hit me and everyone thinksi amstupid for loving someone like him well after that day we argue most of the time and it was all the time cause of his trust issues he thought that i could cheat on him with every guy that past by or that every guy wanted with me he had no trust in any guy i felt like shit i mean id try everything to have a good relationship with him but nothing work i even told him that he shouldnt blame me for the life he had with his exs that i was nothing like them and he reply all girls are the same no one is faithful no more well on may he left to his moms house cause it was impossible being ok with him we agree in getting back together after the baby was born we decided the best for the baby but we still argue trough text all because his ex girlfriend didnt like and she talked so much trash about me and he believed everything she said i told him if he believed everything they talked about me that i would leave him alone that all i wanted was for him to be happy it didnt matter with who but i just wanted his happiness in july 24 after being all weekend together and being happy planing in getting marry in having 3 more kids after the baby was born and after he buying our babys car seat he shot himselfi am not sure why he did it he texted me but i ignore that message he on that day he hit me and broke my nose he left me bleeding and all because of his trust issues so i ignore that message he send then 30 min later his sister called they were looking for him they where worry after i told them what happen they started calling him i saw the message he send me and it saidi amsaying goodbye foreveri am sorry for being the worst for not trusting youi amleaving this miserable world loving you now take care i texted him back told him to not do something stupid out of anger but no reply i started calling him but no answer then i got another message it was a picture of the gun he said let my baby know thati am sorry for leaving him alone that i will be watching over him from where ever i find myself i just dont want no one to cry for me and thats it i came to remember when i gave you your first kiss take care and bye to this miserable world i called him many times i grab my moms keys and drove to that place but i didnt found him i was like thank god his ok when i was heading back home i spotted his car so i headed back and park behind him when i open his door he had the gun in his lap ot seem like if he was sleeping when i moved him he had already shot himself in the head i told him what have you done my love i called 911 but they told me that when i got to him it was already late that they were sorry my lost i felt like dying i couldnt stop crying i just wanted to die with him and right now the only thing that is holding me from not doing something stupid is my unborn baby i dont know whats going to happen with me after my babys is born honestly i just feel like dying 
1,amfeeling i will and its getting worse for each day hi i guess i dont know how to do this i posted in depression but maybe i shouldve posted hereive been depressed for nearly 6 years now and you know it has been worse suicidal and slightly better there was a time for a couple months i thought that maybe life was worth living but it came crashing down again and i cant realy blame myself i wasnt worth enough to have such feelings i dont think i ever wasso i guess when reflecting and talking to my sister we had a pretty sad childhood and got lots of problems still lingering from it and one of my firends when we were out at a pub hes been my friend for like 12 years now he said about my father i can understand why he remaried with someone with children cause he knew hed fucked up with you and wanted to trystart over again and i guess that is true cause all he did was to put my sister and i infront of the tv or computer though my mother wasnt that good either she put me infront of a book good made me scary litterate as a kid but she always had a bad temper like a hellish scream i never heard before and shes very controlling so that wasnt that great either both had to work alot to get things going for them so i guess i didnt really spend that much quality time with my family so i waited for my time to leave and then moved out and today i try to never visit home because i always feel bad wheni amthereand i have been kinda suicidal lately i remember someone asked me if i was ok and only slept bad i kinda then proceeded to do as i always do and push those asking away i dont want to and actually would like to talk with that person about how i feel but i think its not right i think i will try and talk with her about something but i dont know how to askhow should i bring it up that i want to talk about something should i do that wont they be bothered and worried which is worse than not knowing worse than to be surprised than me taking my life and not knowing or believing that they could or would do anything is it right to burden others with the weight of your thoughts especially since you meet them and word could spreadi wish i could cry in front of someone and be hugged i wish i could talk to my friend and tell her how i feel and that i need someone to talk to but i am not quite sure she could take it or help me is it ok to talk to someone is it ok to share what i feel like looking for some sort of comfort can i find comfort in this by talking or will i just ruin everything and risk having her never talk to me again can i risk talking to anyone about this is it right of me to press something on someone is it right to ever make someone possibly feel what i am feeling and my suicidal thoughts
1,i feel likei amlosing emotion and i dont know why i dont thinki am going to commit suicide or anything but after reading a lot and watching this sub for almost a year on a diff acc i figured this was the best place to ask this question in fact ive been meaning to post something for a while i became 23 today and ive realized that ive accomplished very little in my lifei amunemployed atm trying to get a city job but waiting for a calli amsingle and have been a long time and i still havent had my first timei amprobably a selfish brat because i feel likei amlucky to be where i am after reading how hard people have it here i probably dont deserve to ask this question or feel the way i feel but i needed to ask someone this anyone but people i know compared to people in my lifei amvery unsuccessful i dont think i will go far and i will always be below everyone else i was mocked and teased a lot by people i called close friends since highschool and even by my ex love interest who i dated for 5 years total they told me id go nowhere not go places compared to them i feel like no matter what happensi ambelow them and that the life i will live will be unhappy in fact i already feel likei am not even what i used to be my dog died earlier this year i had him for his entire 13 year life and i wasnt sad at his death i felt nothing whenever i see my friends a lot of the time i forget about my shitty position for maybe an hour but then thoughts of my mediocrity sets back in i dont recall the last time i was genuinly happy wheneveri amalone i just think about what a weight off my chest death would be but then i think about how said my friendsfamily might be i happen to be a pretty good actor so i dont ever let me family or my friends see how i truly am or feel they could never know i cant let anyone know i have a problem i dont want them to worry about me the thoughts of suicide based on the fear of my shitty future and loveless life have lingered me for maybe the last 6 years but i could never do it i have some people who really care about me and to think of such a thing i feel is much too selfish but i want to be happy like i used to be what do i do to feel something again thank you all for any advice

1,i just wanna disappear i just moved into my own place in a new town far away from my family and former friends i barely know anybody here and i cant stop thinking about how easy it would be to just disappear i could just end it all and i would never have to feel like this again nobody would ever have to worry about me again all the pain and confusion would be over not just for me but for everyone i know there would finally be peaceitd be so easy to just end it and staying alive seems so very hard right now i dont know what to doi am sorry for not making much sense 
1,i hate my life and wish i wasnt me very long post i recently turned 28 and really feel suicidal for a ton of reasons i didnt have the worst life out there lots of people have much worse lives then me but i honestly feel so deeply depressed about how my life has turned out my mother died last year we had a very difficult relationship my dad went missing a few weeks before my 6th birthday my last memory of him is inviting him to my birthday party and turned up around my birthday in a river we still have no idea what happened to him if it was an accident if he killed himself because of his believed schizophrenic disorders murder who knows my parents already had a bad relationship and werent living together at that point but it changed our lives of course my mother had a ton of mental health problems as well as chronic i willnesses due to having a highly abusive father growing up and a crippling injury and my dads death compounded them not to mention she was raising two children on her own on benefits one of whom was autistic me i was diagnosed with asperger syndrome around this time i love my mom very much but she could be incredibly abusive due to her problems i have memories of her spitting in my face grabbing my hair and shaking my head like a rag doll when she lost control screaming abuse when i knocked over a glass of water i have dyspraxia as well as aspergers which made me very clumsy and struggle with organisation when i was 10 a friend of my mothers went through a psychotic episode and acted like he was going to molest me if someone hadnt come along at that moment i still no idea what might have happened after he started hitting me on the arse and telling me to take my shorts down teenage years were hard as well my mother was very paranoid and i wasnt allowed out the house on my own until i was almost sixteen i had to have an escort walk me to and from school i spent most of primary school and high school being bullied for various reasons and i desperately wanted to make friends yet lacked the social skills to make them often offending people without meaning to and being incredibly defensive so on the rare occasion someone wanted to befriend me i would often be too scared to take them up on it or not realise it it didnt help that mom would often prevent me from doing normal social stuff on the rare occasions i was invited i was also struggling with my sexuality i realised from an early age that i was attracted to boys yet i did my best to suppress this i was already being bullied for being the retard and the special needs kid and was often called faggot and so forth i didnt want to be the weird gay kid as well i didnt want all the bullies who called me faggot to be right so i tried to force myself to be attracted to girls even though i felt nothing towards them it was easier to be in denial then accept i liked boys not girls mom was often quite homophobic she would say some pretty nasty things about gay men and while she had gay friends she found two men having sex to be revolting when she realised i was gay she was quite nasty about it for a while accusing me of prostituting myself for old men she would go through my phone and delete messages from boys i also really hated my body i often thought i was fat or obese but this was because i developed man boobs when i was 12 and was extremely paranoid about them despite actually fluctuating from being very skinny to a modest amount of pudge throughout my life i thought i was obese or extremely fat and ive never taken my shirt off in public as a result even though all i badly wanted to it also made dating extremely difficult on top of everything else it made me absolutely loathe my body it didnt help that i had acne on top of everything else was bullied for my prominent front teeth and my feminine facial features i was often mistaken for a girl i was also born with a small bladder until i was 14 i had to wear diapers to prevent me from wetting the bed and had to have quite a few procedures before medication finally cured me one of which was having metal needles jammed up my urethra when i was six so when i finally cured one problem that led me to be extremely self conscious and miserable another popped up and completely ruined my confidence in my developing body that still hasnt gone away despite constantly struggling with exercise and diet because i was so lonely i turned to binge eating purging and hoarding to make myself feel better i was so controlled in every way that those were the only things i could turn to fill the void created by my loneliness i also hated birthdays a lot of traumatic things happened around them my godfather who was the closest thing i had to a father or indeed any male presence in my life eloped the day before i turned 15 so i had no one to teach me how to shave my fathers side of the family wanted nothing to do with us after dad died and would often try to bully my grandmother into disinheriting me and my sister and my mothers family who i loved very deeply were on the other side of the atlantic so i barely got to see them i did love my only surviving grandmother very deeply and some of my happiest childhood memories are of her she died some years ago and had resisted her daughters attempts to bully her to disinherit me and my sister though my aunts were incredibly hateful over this and did their best to remind me and my sister that they considered us thieves and entitled brats for not giving them their brothers share of my grandmothers estate i miss my grandma so very much she was one of the few people who ever gave me unconditional love and sometimes i play the music box i got her for christmas one year and think of her it was a snow globe with her favourite flowers and bird inside it and i feel so deeply nostalgic when i play it i eventually got into my dream university but because of my severe depression i would just lock myself in my dorm room binge eat and cry having absolutely no idea how to break out of it i was very lonely it ended up feeling more like the bell jar then my dreams finally coming true by the time it was over i came very close to killing myself and spent most of that year in a suicidally depressed state i eventually got to redo my final year and made some wonderful friends who became a surrogate family i was still sexually and romantically frustrated due to my binge eating finally taking its toll and i gained a lot of weight during my depressive episode eventually i graduated and had to move out but i was finally happy in many ways due to finally getting the social life i wanted i finally was getting invited to parties and doing fun things mom had gotten very i will at this time so i spent the year after graduating struggling to sort out my life and look after her at the same time she became more and more emotionally volatile as her mental health was affected by her physical healths rapid decline eventually i took my life savings together and moved out thinking i could look after her better if i had my own space and i was tired of feeling ripped apart by loving her and resenting her for so many things six weeks later i got a call from the hospital saying she had been admitted for the next three months she was in and out of the hospital i hated going there i had put everything on the line to get my own place and fix my life and let go of the past and i kept having to go to a hospital and see my mother decline throw tantrums when she would ask me to bring or buy certain thing for her and then change her mind all the while biting my tongue because i didnt want to lose my temper in a ward full of frail old ladies coughing blood and even though i had really really thought i hated my mother at this point i still loved her and hated to see her suffer so much my mental health had already been dangling by a thread for quite some time eventually we got another call from the hospital and my mother passed that evening from multiple organ failure i remember staring at the heart monitor praying with every fibre of my being for it to keep going holding my mothers hand until the nurse said her heart had stopped and the machine was switched off i said goodbye to my mom and felt deep anguish she was never going to meet her grandchildren something she deeply wanted for all her flaws as a mother she loved children and it would have been so healing to see her as a devoted grandmother i smoked a cigarette outside and spent the next few days crying my heart out things got even worse my mother had not made a will and since the area we lived in the area that had been full of stabbings all my life was now a very gentrified area the house was now worth a lot of money which meant an insane amount of inheritance tax my mother was a very bad hoarder as well so the past year and a half has been struggling to clear out her things and make the huge inheritance tax bill the first of which came six months after her death i eventually had to move out of my place and back into the family home due to the inheritance tax taking all my savings and inheritance and now i guess ive reached my breaking pointi am28 still have man boobs have no money havent had a boyfriend in eight years coming up to nine have never had a job just volunteer work and have missed out on so much of life when i clear out moms stuff and take it to the charity shop the loss hits me so many things are mixed up in there and it reminds me of times when i was either happy or hopeful for the future and it feels so bitter that i cant go back to those times all thats left of my parents are two urns sitting side by side containing their ashes my sister lives overseas so i have no family left in the country i just want to redo my life and not be autistic or gay or have man boobs or have had so many mental and physical health problems or have had more family around me growing up people who could have gotten me away from my mother and taught me to be an adult so i wouldnt have been so emotionally stunted and isolated for most of my life helped me get into shape helped me grow up so i could have had a social life in my teens and twenties maybe even gotten to the point where i could have had a nice boyfriend or two instead of years of sexual and romantic frustration i see my friends still but sometimes its painful because it reminds me of how different my life has been from theirs they had families are in relationships are in careers and have had financial stability growing up some of them are going on holiday and backpacking through exciting places yet me i am absolutely broke from having to pay a huge tax bill every year i dont know i keep slipping into these daydreams were i didnt have so much shit happen to me where i am not autistic where i didnt have such an unstable upbringing where i met a nice boyfriend and didnt have these two things on my chest that absolutely ruined my confidence that wouldnt shift no matter how much exercise i did a guy who i could go on dates with play games with snuggle up to at night and have a satisfying sex life with someone who would take me home to meet his family i wish my parents were still alive and had been a bit more normal i wish i wasnt born with so many things wrong with my body and mind that came together to make me far more isolated and sad then i could bear i wish i had had a big family around me growing up i just wish i had had a bit more stability and normality then all this chaos i dont know i am on the waiting list for grief therapy and i see a counsellor but i feel so deeply sad about how much of life i have missed out on and am still missing out on due to being held back by such a crippling amount of debt i want to kill myself but i know i couldnt do that to my loved ones i dont know why i wrote this venting i guess i keep wishing i could redo my life i wish some pieces had come together better like if i had to be autistic i didnt have to be gay as well if i had to lose my dad i didnt have to lose my mom as well that my mom hadnt had so many things wrong with her because she wasnt a bad person just very damaged physically and mentally that my family in america had been around so they could have given me a bit more of a balanced upbringing that my uncle and aunts had been around to get my mom to back off a bit that my cousins had been the big brothers i needed to be a man teach me to shave take me out helped me work out how to socialise that i had my baby cousins to look after read stories too play games with because i always wanted to be a big brother too and was often sad that i didnt have babies and kids to look after i have two godchildren which has been wonderful but it does make me wistful that i never had any younger siblings growing up that i had known that man boobs could have been fixed with surgery so i knew what it was like to take my shirt off at the beach i wish i could have more experience with dating instead of hooking up with older men as no one my age gave me the time of day i wish i had a nice boyfriend i wish i hadnt had a hormone imbalance that made me loathe my body and made me bundle myself up in clothes to hide it and never take my shirt off i feel selfish for wanting to turn back time as the world doesnt revolve around my happiness i just wish there had been a bit more balance i didnt expect a happy life handed to me on a platter i just wish so many burdens hadnt been given to me that prevented me from having the life i wanted i just wish i could redo my teens and twenties without some of them so things were a bit more bearable and happy and less of a lonely isolating struggle theres a lot more i havent mentioned but i just wish i could wake up and have it be a long time ago before so many things got worse and worse i know its very self indulgent because some people have it so much worse but i just hate myself and i hate being me i just wish things hadnt been such a struggle and i wasnt going through losing my mom and having a colossal financial crisis on top of everything else i guess losing my mom has opened up a lot of old wounds its made me feel wistful for past times and deeply miss my dad and grandma and wish i could have had things be a bit more normal to be a bit more like my peers and be in a bitter place to cope with this loss now i wish it was years ago making my grandma a cup of tea and sitting in the garden with her or playing ocarina of time for the first time that magical moment when a boy kissed me for the first time time passes it feel so strange there was a time when i was a child or a young teen or a twenty year old and i actually had hope that things would get better instead of so much worse it feels sad that i feel nostalgic for those fleeting moments of happiness in a life ive found often so very sad and unbearably lonely i feel like wanting to hit the reset button makes me a bad person its impossible and selfish like the whole world revolves around my happiness i cant help it though if i could make those daydreams of being young and in love and having my family be more normal and alive around and getting to be more social as a teen and twenty something happen i would i know its a lot of whine here but i guess i just wanted to get things off my chest i know i have to a accept the past and that its gone and its written but i just wish things had been less awful i keep thinking if this was how my life was going to be why was i born i didnt ask to be an orphaned gay autistic man child with tits from a poverty stricken unstable background thats never been in love and has been so very very lonely for almost my entire life sometimes i wish id never been born or id killed myself years ago thank you for reading
1,37 years and counting english is not my first language so i apologize in advance for any mistakes i am 37 years old i live in a major city of south america i have an ok job that allows me to live with no financial worries i also have a masters degree and a good reputation among some people in my field but i want to die everydayi guess it all comes from the realization that we are irreparably alone that love is an i willusion that romantic love is an invention so deeply inoculated in our societies that we are all screwed up for goodat least that is the way i rationalized the loss of my ex she is from europe and she lived with me for a year and a half suddenly she didnt want to have sex and started to came late from her meetings with her friends in december 2016 she went to england to her masters graduation and i stayed in my country because i thought she needed space to make the story short i discovered she was cheating on me with an english guy she met at her job in my country and she was traveling through england with himin less than six months she left my country and went to england to live with that guyit is been nine months since we split and i am tired of this thing we call life i cant even think of falling in love again i dont want to kill myself but i just cant make sense of anything anymore the more i read the more i travel the more i listen to music the more i think about killing myselfmy exs infidelity was just the trigger to something ive always had inside me i dont even know why i am sharing this ive read a lot of the posts in here and i dont even feel sympathy for anyone but i feel solidarity with them i truly believe society must provide the human beens like us a painless way to commit suicide without all the censorship and guilty some people want us to feelin the meantime i am 37 year old and waiting to die life is a painfully slow waiting for nothing to happen
1,amno doubt going to kill myself at one point in my life i just cant do it anymore drugs really make me cope i dont like going to the doctors i dont like even talking when i talk someone gets pissed off ever since i was a child i would go long periods of time without talking it just felt overbearing to talk like dirty to me i even hate the quick convos for chatting about buying drugs i just want the guy to set a date and every week at the same time i pick it up without even seeing each other or talking anyways i plan to kill myself at one point in my life and it really just feels like a release just saying it thinking about dying just releases all of this tightness within my cranial cavity and i just feel bliss 
1,i go back and forth about dying and not dying i just went through a really hard breakup my ex and i are communicating which makes things more confusing hes friendly enough but i just would like to know where he stands my job is also slowly killing me i keep reading about how to commit suicide but all the methods i read about are too terrifying for me to try i want something painless but i amalso sort of scared to die as scared as i am of dying though i really am tired of living and have been for a long time i feel like i cant reach out to anyone so thats whyi amhere i guess
1,rick and morty i need more shows with characters like rick i need to see a character whose whole attitude isi am going to do whatever i want and not worry about the consequences becausei amsuicidal anyway and if i die theni amcool with that but if i dont and just have a really awesome experience then thats cool tooit kinda makes me feel like someone as shitty and suicidal as me can do things that arent 100 ruined by my participation in them
1,i can relate to this quote from movie called i stand alone 1998 being born against your will eat wave your dick around make new life die life is one big void its always been and itll always be a large void that can do just fine without me i dont want to play that game anymore not in this life i want to experience something personal something intense i dont want to be the final replaceable part of a giant machine i dont know i must find a reason an excuse or what ever to find the motivation to go on another 20 years until i die if i start my life all over id want to make porn movies its all clear the people who do that understand the human race either youre born with a cock which has to be a big hard dick filling snatches or youre born with a pussy which has to be filled with cock in both scenarios youll still be alone yeahi ama dick thats iti ama sad sad dick and to earn some respect i must be hard all the time

1,recent thoughts of suicide and talking to someone about it hey ive always ignored how much i thought about suicide in the past most recently i decided to pay attention and ended up realizing that i think at least a couple times a day what would life be without me how the life of my loved ones would move forward which way id choose to gomy family is very strict about this subject my uncle commited suicide about 11 years ago and almost no one ever talked about it and talking to them about whati amfeeling will just cause unnecessary pain and concernon the other hand ive been with this girl for the past 8 months and its been great weve never talked about depression or suicide specifically but ive mentioned a few times how fucked up my life wascan be having her around is great and honestly one of the few things that i really enjoy lately though shes gonna study abroad for a year yeah thats messing me up a bit but anywayi just wanna know if i should talk to her about it and how i can do it so that she doesnt feel guilty will it help me will it fuck up our relationshipim afraid that those intrusive thoughts will escalate into something more real more intense

1,please help meis there anyone on here willing to listen i am feeling suicidal today for the first time in about 5 months i will do my best to sum things up here however its still going to be long either wayi amafraid had depressionanxietylow self esteemptsd for a number of years been having dbt therapy weekly for nearly two years now has been incredibly helpful more so than any other therapy ive tried medications etc a couple of months back a had a turning point with the therapy and could really feel the impact it had had i felt truly positive for the first time in years truly happy like i was able to conquer anything and it wasnt fake this time and i know what that feels like this wasnt it this was different i was doing incredibly well however a couple of months ago after speaking with my therapist about it for a while i decided to get back in contact with my absent father since parents divorce when i was 15 now 27 via a long letter i got short response letter back a week later the response was fairly positive however the phone call we had two days later was not and he was belittling insulting about my epilepsy brought up the past was derogatory towards my mum lied about a few things etc ended very badly and i ended contact with him for good since then i have taken about 10 steps back therapywise and it has been affecting every area of my life but particularly my relationship with my boyfriend which started just before i got in contact with my dad again everything was great with my boyfriend before because i actually felt good enough i felt positive all the time and because i felt good enough i had nothing to worry about but nowi have the same question that has come back that has haunted me for years and even though there is a rational part of me that knows it is my dad with the problem and not mei still end up chalking it down to me not being good enough for him or anyone that question is if my dad doesnt love me who will or similar questions if my dad wont stick by me what man will i only seem to see the negative and not the positive like my mum sticking by me because my negative thoughts and worries are so powerful that i truly believe my mum and anyone else in my life including my boyfriend would be better off without me i dont even think they want me in their lives i cant tell my boyfriend any of this because ive only been with him for about 9 weeks and although he knows the dad stuff and some things from my past and he was understanding and helpful if i tell himi amsuicidal right now thats a one way ticket to losing a boyfriend i dont want to tell any of my friends i already feel like they dont want to talk to me most of the time and when i do talk to them i feel like because we hardly speak because we live far apart etc i dont want to be that debbie downer every time i speak to themi amjust pushing everyone away when i speak to them and when i dont speak to them i feel paranoid and suspicious about my boyfriend a lot i never feel good enough but then i feel no man is good enough for me my standards are so incredibly high because of my past with abusive relationships i cant even explain everything in this post and nowi amjust rambling i dont know what to do i cant stop crying i just hate myself and i hate my braini am in a constant battle with it when i get in states like this even when i dont feel suicidal i struggle so much with pushing negative thoughts out of my mind they are so much easier to believe than positive ones will i ever feel good enough why is there no painless way to end everything i cant get a break from my overthinking i cant even speak to my therapist about it most of the time because shes not an on call therapist and i only see her weekly for 50 mins and in the moods ive been in the past month or so most of the time ive felt like i could talk to someone for hours

1,i thought i found a reason i thought that the thing which kept me for years actually happened again and i feel in love maybe i get pushed away maybe these loves never come true but atleast falling for someone helped to climb out of my hole high enough to have a pretty long way before i can keep digging but now this seems to be over i was at the most terrible point in my life i thought i would find something but i cant believe into anything no friends no family no partner i dont even mean romantical love i just mean any way of love starting by myself ending with a partner but i must admit that this seems to be over for mei amat the bottom and i feel that soon i will have been digging so deep that i am going to fall into the abyss in my dreams but on the hard floor 6 floors deep in real life

1,a cry for help i guess for the past several years ive been depressed not majorly depressed though id have moments of happiness but even in the moments where i would be laughing and enjoying myself there was always the subtle weight of depression hanging over my head as the years went on that feeling just kept getting stronger and stronger ive dealt with suicidal thoughts in the past but they were always just thoughts i always knew i would never actually do it but in the past few weeks these suicidal thoughts have been much louder and theyre starting to sound more and more rational ive always been quiet and introverted i dont like talking to the people in my life about anything serious i just hide my depression behind thick layers of ironic humor and its fucked me up over the yearsi amcompletely lost and suicide sounds so fucking relaxing now knowing that i could just end all my problems and suffering so easily is such a comforting thoughti ama junior in university just transferred here from a community college ive never known how to make friends nowi amliving on campus with a bunch of people i dont know not talking to anyone not going out not meeting new peoplei ama business major so theres a lot of pressure to be active in activities and get experience to add to my resume so i can get an internship and look attractive to employers but i cant do any of that my social anxiety is so fucking strong how the hell am i supposed to get through life if i cant even do simple shit like talking to people life is supposed to be a healthy mix of doing things you enjoy and doing things you dont enjoy i know its not rational for a person to be happy all the time enjoying every moment theyre in but for me especially lately there are seldom moments where i findi amhappy the majority of my time is spent doing things i dont want to do i dont find joy in anything anymore nothing excites me nothing can motivate me i feel so disconnected from other people everything is so dull even the things that i used to really enjoy like sex for example is just so bland sex used to be the one thing that i had that i really enjoyed i used it to cope with my depression for the longest time but now thats turned dull just like everything else if i dont find anything enjoyable anymore then whats the point i genuinely cannot think of a reason to not kill myself theres no reward in life anymore why would i stick around its all just fucking shit and dealing with sadness and discomfort and anxiety all the time i so badly want to just not exist i dont know whyi amwriting this ive never talked to anyone about any of this because i dont know how to ask for help i guessi amjust hoping someone can convince me that life is worth living becausei amgetting scared at how enticing suicide is becoming 
1,i just am lost gonna end it today i am not going to use caps in this sorry ya grammar nazis hi i never thought it would come to asking the internet for help but here i am i have considered suicide since a young age i always pushed past those phases but lately i am just having doubts doubts i will ever be accepted or love i have been putting on a facade for years no one around me really knows how i feel how ever night i pull out my moms pills to hold in my hands for hours how i take late walks to the bridge and look over it it is almost comforting thinking about dropping my worries let me explain i guess i am still not an adult but not young enough to have no expectations i am a junior in highschool lately my mom and dad have been going at it again from a young age my dad has been addicted to meth he would stand in my moms face and call her unspeakable things he would stand in the living room with a knife to his neck demanding money he would get it and just leave like nothing happened my mom also suffers from extreme depression she had quit her job at one point in the summer and laid in bed naked for 4 days during those days i watched and cared for all my siblings 3 brothers two of which have autism schizophrenia and aspergers some other smaller mental disorders that caused the oldest to become easily attached to things and 1 sister the youngest hadnt been born till a year and a half after my older brother my only older sibling was abusive he would threaten to gut me and chase me with knives he constantly beat me and i couldnt fight back not because i wasnt strong enough but because i couldnt bring myself to hurt him anyways those days of no adults and me stepping up to plate have really affected me lately i have had nightmares of those days and how hopeless i felt i had no one to tuck me in my mom bless her heart had always been there i was mortified of being alone after that things got worst one night not to long after my dad came back he was angry the house wasnt clean and my mom still lied in bed he proceded to hurt her and threaten us i remember grabbing a knife and rushing to grab my siblings but he hit me hard i had never been so terrified from that point on my mom and dad have been at each others necks he still to this day is addicted to meth and my mom still speaks of killing herself i am a relatively popular person i have friends and i actually like that they are the only thing keeping me afloat i like other people got into bad eating habits at a young age years of mom going to mcdonalds every night for dinner conditioned my body for the future junk food it became my comfort after elementary middle school was awful i grew up in a city called omaha some might know it but it is a very bad city at least where i lived north omaha i was ridiculed for being fat i also developed love for well men i was called fag and beat up constantly i had always been bullied whether for being poor fat or fugly i was mortified for two years one thing i said haunted me and caused all my friends to leave me and become my enemies the day i said i am gay you might be think you cant decide your sexuality at that age but in north omaha everyone was already losing their virginity by seventh grade i just didnt feel attracted to girls i had one friend to get me through the one person i never told even to this day my cousin me and my cousin like most family grew less close over the years he moved constantly and his mom who was in the army was stationed in germany i lose my best friend and was all alone till high school then we finally moved i wont say where because i am still living there but it was further into iowa i was able to be myself and have friends i was ecstatic i was finally happy but but things change i guess i just have grown hopeless i notice the looks of disgust i get from my friends i am not very good looking obviously i have lose some weight over the years like 30 pounds or so and i thought i was happy with myself but recently i was just going to school and someone called me fag i i was confused and i i thought that almost adults would be accepting or at least tolerant of me but i guess that is hopeless too i am so tired of the looks i get of the people around me changing about my family about how now when i look in the mirror all i see are flaws no matter how hard i try no matter what i do no matter how much i pray to god to be merciful the blows keep coming they dont stop i never have been happy i sit and nod my head smiling when my friends talk to me smile whenever people catch me frowning i just cant go on living lies i know i am not happy i know i am ugly and fat and stupid i am just lying thinking about how i could end it i dont want my family to wake up to a dead body i cannot imagine that even if i dont always like them i love my family i dont want them to think this is completely their fault i am gonna throw myself in the missouri river tomorrow night i just want to not feel anything anymore i dont want to worry about college or stopping my parents from hitting each other or worrying about how i look or keep thinking about how my life is going to be just like my dads a drug addict who beats his wife i hate it i hate crying but i am crying right now i just cant but the thing is i am scared i dont want to die i just want to start over every bad thing in my life couldve been solved i couldve called cps i couldve not come out i could have worked out and eaten right i could have helped more people done more for others i know there are other people suffering and people way worse off but right now that isnt enough to stop me i am a self loathing attention whore i know and posting here is just going to justify that but before i do end it i just want to laugh i want to feel warmth again i know i sound emo but i just miss getting hugs and sleeping by my mom and dad i miss the days when school was fun and i wasnt worrying about everyone judging me and about how well i am doing i hate it i hate myself i just want to see my grandma again all those days i spent scrapbooking and cooking with her are my best memories but she is gone and no one in the world gives a shit so if i disappear will anyone really care and no i know everyone will be sad for like a few weeks and yatta yatta but in a year no one will remember who i was the art i did the songs i sang the games i played will be boxes thrown in the attic everyone will forget for the best of course i am not sad i just think that the life i am living isnt mine anymore i am hurt my family my friends myself they left me broken and i glued myself back together with religion and games and music and school but now the glue has come undone i just dont care anymore i cannot put on those smiles anymore i cant belt out notes anymore i cant make art anymore i cant do anything right i am a peice of shit this world would be better off without me some whiny fag thanks for reading my life i will be done i am sorry for being me i know i am being selfish right now but damnit i have tried for other people for too long goodbye i hope you will at least have the kindness to post some funny memes below anything to get me to smile please i appreciate it thanks
1,morning thoughts there was a time i believedas i aged my emotions would subside in hindsight i have learnedto bury those feelings deep withinstill i have days where i am consumed i have asked to die more times than i can count but still i sit here writing to no onei am still on this earth as it spins silentlythrough the darkness of eternity when i was younger there were nights the fear of my mortality would paralyze methough now i look at the inevitable and am happy to oblige to leave this cesspool of anger and hateto no longer be bothered by the corporationsdrunk on greed who run this world i have seen the wrath of evil first hand i have seen the aftermath left in its wakei have been subjected to cruel judgments i have been told to crawl in a hole and die i have starved myself to feel confident i have cut myself to focus on the paini have drugged myself to feel happy even if its fleeting what terrifies me thoughi finally realized i have lost myself in this world
1,nobody will ever love me all of the relationships ive ever had were just internet relationships and none of them ended well the one person i had a crush on who was my best friend already found someone else that they are in love with i feel like i will never have anyonei amtransgender and i have social anxiety too which doesnt help either i just want someone to love me but obviously thats never going to happen
1,i really wish i could contract some extremely lethal diseasei am really fed up with life i knowi am going nowhere and i just dont want to be around anymore death is best for me but i feel too weak to kill myself so ive been recently hoping for some horrible accident to happen to me so i can be dead i wont have to upset people who know me and i wont have to go to the effort of killing myself
1,failed hanging i dont know if anyone can help or advise briefly ive always had issues with stress panic attacks and anxiety recently getting worse and worse the other morning got up got changed for work decided enough was enough and hung myself no note not a cry for help was just gonna do it i blacked out and woke up on the floor covered in snot and tears the cheap star wars dressing gown belt had snapped i know if it hadnt i would of gone i dont know where to go from here i am too ashamed to tell my family girlfriend work and the hurt it will cause i dont want their sympathy i dont want to feel like that again any advice 
1,its not like i dont have a will to live its just like i have no fear of dying and its killing me inside i guess a bit of background would help i have low selfesteem usually overshadowed by my cousin who is far better to my schools eyes i was physically abused when i was a kid and i was a child of a mistressi ambasically a result of a ruined marriage and my mom and i leaving my dad left him in deep depression he still talks to me these days via fb and it just hurtsthese things dont bother that much not directly to the point of suicide and i knowi ambetter than my cousin in different ways and thati am not a mistake thati am not defined by my past or my orgins i just think they somehow were the reasons of my selfdestructive naturei dont mind doing reckless things i have thoughts of jumping off buildings sometimes literally standing along the ledge i contemplate cutting my wrists or grating my hand never doing it though i have thoughts of getting drunk hitching a ride at night with a stranger do drugs anything to stimulate my mind i suppose its like everything else just bores me to death i just feel so emptybut the thing i hate the most the thing that drove me to write this post about my behavior is how i ruin relationships i read about selfdestructive behavior on the wikipedia and there was one section that basically described itselfdestructive behavior may also manifest itself in an active attempt to drive away other people for example they may fear that they will mess up a relationship rather than deal with this fear socially selfdestructive individuals engage in annoying or alienating behavior so that others will reject them firstand it hit me pretty hard today because i think i just fucked up a relationship with someone i truly liked my chest aches a lot right now and its pretty cheesy but i have this fear that i will do it to all that i really care about i feel like nothing really ever matters and i should just keep on with this i feel so safe like this and like if nothing really matters nothing can hurt me i know that this reckless behavior is just a coping mechanism for meand i think that theres a way to be truly happy without this i hope for onei cant rely on parents or friends theyre all avid christians and i dont believe in a god i just dont think religion is necessary for me so thats why i turned herehonestly i wouldve ended it all now if it wasnt for my mom she endured my existence and let me live a pretty good life my death would only be selfish and devastate herso has anyone ever felt this i just want a way out and i know suicide wont help but it just seems like the only option right nowi am so empty
1,i have always known i would die by my own hand short version i am a 54yo female abused sexually physically and emotionally from age 316 multiple actors tried to kill my self for the third time many previous cries for help in july cannot get it done husband now has memory loss and am caring for 91yo mother have no friends left and my family has never been there for me husbands friends and family have either died or abandoned us in another way i also have multiple medical problems the worst of which are spinal stenosis and lumbar spondylosis which cause chronic pain for which they will not give me any opiates due to my psych history neither hubby nor i can work and live on less than 1700month on ss disabilitymy psychiatrist and therapist have become complacent psych had a fairly good med combo but it did not keep the last attempt at bay therapists is okay but mostly i think that she is amused by me not in a bad way though she just doesnt direct the conversation or make me work on anything neither suggested hospitalization after this most recent event they do not know everything about my past mostly just the light molestation by my stepdad but everything about my presentmy pcp i rarely see and her np is virtually useless this was not always true prior to their takeover by a corporate hospital group they used to actually listen but have no time and their hands are tied as far as options they are aware of my attempts but not my upbringingi guess i am just tired of trying and getting it wrong first real attempt was when i was 18 just married had an affair with hubbys bff and realized that leaving my childhood home did not solve all of my problems pills and booze not recognized by anyone as an attempt so not hospitalizedsecond attempt was after the hubby had an affair with our bff and she said she was pregnant with his baby due to my childhood i cannot have kids so the pregnancy was the kicker that was an attempted asphyxiation think those guys they find hanging but i was not masturbatingthis last time i took almost six times the lethal dose of a medication that i am on not commonly used for suicide and all i got was two knees bruised so badly that i could not walk for 3 days and i spent two of those days hallucinating hubby did not even attempt to get me help and actively tried to talk me out of calling 911not normally a whiner but i am just really frustrated that no matter how much i try to get things right doing research and such i am still stuck here i do finally have what i assume is a fool proof plan that does not include a gun since i cannot purchase one legally and no longer have any connections to get one i willegally i am also not really looking for any kind of help living or dying unless you can give me the winning powerball numbers so i can afford a good nursing home for mom and maybe hubby just looking to get it off my chest i guess
1,if anyone needs help please pm me i am like you i have problems to yei amjust having a pretty shitty year with school life and other shit just need someone to talk

1,why is suicide consider a bad thing i have lost everything in the last month including friends and my girlfriend no one seemed to care that i did until i started taking drugs and alcohol then everyone calls me selfish and my ex girlfriend kept preventing me from doing it why cant i just be left alone
1,i dont want to do this anymorei am so tired i hate waking up every day and being me everything is too fucking hard going about my day talking to people even thingsi amsupposed to like if it wasnt for some people that care for me for whatever reason id do it right now but nowi amstarting to resent my friends and family for being the reasoni am not hanging from somewhere i hate everything and i want to die 
1,the most loved person of mine so everything started about a month ago when i meet a girl from portugal we talked a lot and got to know eachother pretty well weve been together for all of that time and it was the best thing that could have happened to me when i told her that i need about 2 weeks to study she was ok with it after i passed my exams she made a new friend which she calls bae she doesnt even call me like that when with her friends but him of course she calls him bae whenever i want to talk to her shes in defensive mode and tries to not talk to me by any meaning when i begged her to speak with me she tried finding excuses and ended up lying me that her phone died i literally never met someone like her shes the most perfect person ive ever meet ive been dealing with depression since 4 years ago when my mom literally died crying for me i just wanted someone to love i offered to pay for her to come in the uk next year and move with me she agreed but now everything is ruined i can assure you that no other girl is like she is i wont ever find someone like her my life literally has no meaning at all right now what am i supposed to do she is just hiding stuff and doesnt wanna talk to me i know she was dealing with depression as much as i was but that doesnt make any sense the guy looks like just a friend for her but i dont know why she was like that i told her thati am going to kill myself which i think i will and she didnt even tried to tell me not to do it she just ignored me and told me to leave her alone i was about to commite suicide before i meet her but she gave me a reason to still try but now everything is gone there are still alot of things i didnt said about her there is no chance i would forget her i just wanna be back with her but i cant do anything 
1,my psychiatrist left me like everyone else does i had my follow up appointment with what is my third psychiatrist in maybe two months and she told me i needed to see someone else because she couldnt help me i should have known she too would get tired of mereject metell me to leave i made the mistake of being honest with her and telling her about my love addiction she basically told me what everyone tells me which is that i need to put myself first and stop dating and blah blah blah i dont mean to sound like a brati amjust so tired of people telling me the same thingi am tired of telling myself the same thing i dont know if i can do this anymorei amcertifiably crazy ive been inpatient more than five times ive been diagnosed and prescribed ive taken intensive dbt to combat the big bad in my life known as borderline personality disorder something i initially rejected because it sounded more like it should be named being human but now embrace as my issue ive been around the block its not my first rodeo this is my life now i cry and oversleep and try to stay alive for the people in my life i am very fortunate to have a considerable number of people in my life who have said they care deeply about me and want to see me thrive and survive there are times when i too want to see myself thrive and survive but i was say thats 310 days the rest of the time i feel like i cant deal with the crushing weight of just breathingi am so torn between killing myself and trying to fight that i think maybe i should have myself permanently committed that way i can hide from the world but the people who say they love me can still see me if they want its compromise but that costs a lot of money i think and its probably not fair to the psychotic people who simply cant function even if they want to at least i can put on a show when i want tohave toi amtethered to reality and have never experienced psychosis which is something i should be grateful for and on a certain level i really am but its not enough i think thats my issue its not enough there is simply one thing that is enough loveromance if i am dating i am on top of the world there is a reason to live and a point to it all and i can fight anything and overcome everything i am euphoric i am almost invincible and i am probably really fun to be around too my entire happiness is hinged on my newfound relationship and ifwhen that goes away everything understandably falls apart when i tell myselfi ambeing unreasonable and delete all the apps block all the numbers and erase all the pictures thats when withdrawal sets in the empty feeling in my chest now correctly identified as anxiety by my last therapist compounds and i feel as if i am walking with a hundred pound weight attached to my sternum every car is an opportunity every train a potential escape forever i live in new york city its torturous i have no suicide note or manifesto i dont want my failed romances to feel sorry if i die honestly i wish theyd just forget all about me i dont want anyone to feel pain for the ways they may have wronged me in the past i am not seeking revenge in any way shape or form i just want this to end i literally just want the pain to fucking end if i didnt feel this awful compulsion and the emptiness that followed denying it i would be fine i would be able to deal with my life i presume but this is too much this pain is way too much nothing has helped and today has just been proof that it doesnt matter if i beg them fuck them or pay them no one will deal with me for very long my own mother shuts me out and gives me the cold shoulder when it becomes too much i dont blame her i wish it didnt have to be this way but i honestly dont know what to do please give me advice on how to die ive read about short drop hanging and nitrogen i live in a regular house and the basement is empty i havent inspected it muchthere might be some good prospects but i am not really looking at things with an educated eye websites can only help so much and they often like to tell you about all the ways you might fail or try to reverse psychology you some other way reddit is cold and practical in many ways so thats why ive come here please help me put an end to this pain if theres some kind of afterlife i will be eternally grateful

1,not sure if this is the right place to ask but i just need to sometimes i just have thoughts of how nice it would be to just kill myself or be deadi am not suffering from depression and compared to all the people who need an ear on this sub i have a good life however like i said i just would rather be dead 80 of my day i was wondering why this could be if any of you could help i dont thinki amsuicidal but i knowi ama huge failure so far in life and knowing that just makes every day feel long and i just want my short life to end already my question really is just do any of you know what could be bringing on these thoughts my doctor saysi am not depressed
1,i know i shouldnt ask for medical help but roughly 45 days ago i was in hospital for a suicide attempt overdose i took 20 225mg venlafaxine 24 valium and a few sleeping pills all on an empty stomach and with alcohol i was discharged from hospital after staying in and being assessed but noone told me anything ever since ive had horrible stomach cramps and i amconstantly feeling sick in the mornings and after food is this normal thank you remove if breaking rules x
1,christians is it morally wrong to wish for death i dont think i could kill myself as that would be against my faith but i want to die please help is it against your faith it definitely would be considered bad in some cases as it is an act of intentional killing murder many scholars believe since you can not ask for redemption on earth its simply a way to hell god will forgive us our sins when we pray to him and seek redemption however you cant exactly be sincere about it as you conduct the action if you really want to be moral and a good christian than its simple give your life to god join the church or a monastery and become a monkvolunteer and live your life only for god and no one else not even for yourself 
1,tonights the night goodbye thank you for everything youve given me my note is in the top left drawer of my vanity i love you
1,are there any websites that provide proper guides to easy and painless suicide ive been watching a few videos over the last week on youtube about how to tie a noose to hang myself but i am not sure if i can do it right id prefer just to painlessly over dose on some combination of drugs really i tried killing myself by eating peanuts because i was allergic to them but it seems i grew out of my allergy because i didnt get a reaction
1,am doing it tomorrow ive chosen not to wait anymore well technically 1 more night but i probably wont sleep my note is written and ive sent texts thanking what few friends i have i just wish there was another way or wish i could see it but i think i can do it this timei amgonna get wasted get in the car turn up the radio and carbon dioxide myself to sleep for goodif any of my friends see thisi am sooo sorry its not your fault
1,my life is just crumbling i dont have anyone to talk to so i figured i should come here i dont know what to do suicide has been on my mind heavy for weekswell really for the past ten years what do you do when youre in your life completely alone when all you want is to find any way to get fucked up to be numb all i want to do is die but i amentirely too chicken to do it myself so i have to sit miserable hating everything about myself until someone feels bad enough for me to just go ahead put me out of my misery i think about it too much i just want the pain to stop i need someone to show compassion love act like it would destroy them to lose me like it destroys me every time theres always someone more important when am i going to be the one that matters i dont know whyi ameven trying to look for compassioni am sorry
1,i want to die that is all
1,yo am i worthy of living so heres the deal ive been miserable for years now at least six but maybe more in that time ive tried the usual suspects exercise meditation relationships it has all kind of amounted to nothing not to say i havent learned anything from those experiences but i cant shake this feeling that i will end up killing myself someday no matter what i do i seem to be stuck in a cycle of thinking things are about to get betterrealizing things are getting worseits like a roller coaster ride that never ends except instead of being terrified all the time with relief at the end i drift between debilitating sadness and listless anxiety i really dont know what to do it may be easier for me to end my life since there doesnt seem to be a solution i dunnoi am not even emotional about dying anymore i just see it as a logical choice in the face of a really awful world hey thanks for reading this far 3
1,i am no one i am 31 years old i work full time and then some in social services typically i work 50 hours a week but i can barely make ends meet i took a week off in july and without the overtime i took such a financial hit i almost couldnt buy food and i didnt even do anything or go anywhere it was literally just a staycation where i mostly played video games or went on walks to the parki am31 with a college degree and i have to get a second job and essentially work 7 days a week so i can save money i have no life now because i cant afford it i will have no life then because i wont have time and it is an endless cycle i am tired i feel heavy air hurts my skin feels raw and as much as i want to feel guilty i can only feel at peace in the knowledge that sometime soon i will die and i will be the one to do it that when it is over everyone else will be sad but eventually they will move on theyll get on with their lives and i will no longer be the fuckup burden they feel obligated to invite places or required to talk to they wont have me to support financially and emotionally what i hope to gain is freedom and i hope to provide it as well i do not like who i am i am not happy i have not been happy for a very long time i have always been unsuccessful in relationships i try so many things and can barely rise to mediocrity and when people sayi amgood at something or they like me it just feels like a lie it feels like they are making fun of me it always has felt that way and i am tired and i just want to be done now 
1,i hate this city and i cant move i feel like i dont have any options i am an early20sf living in a dangerous city for grad school i have about 4 more years in my phd this city is terrible walking home in the middle of the day today i stopped at a crosswalk waiting for the light to change i got pushed and shoved by a sleazy man who started berating me calling me a whre asking if i am trying to sell myself said that i must be a cheap whre as my nails arent even done etc i said leave me alone and two other men started saying the same things i immediately turned and walked the other direction as they yelled profanities and screamed at me there were tons of other people around and no one said anything to them or even attempted to help me i cant believe that the mid30s couple at the same crosswalk didnt say anything i was on the phone with my mom the entire time she heard everythingthis is not even close to the first time that this has happened this is not the worst experience i have even had this kind of encounter with homeless mentally i will high people happens at least once a week on public transportation so this was not a byproduct of walking home i hate this city i hate living here i love my school though also everyone is very proud of me for going here my parents have told everyone that i am attending grad school here and they already call me doctor mylastname in a loving way because they are so proud of me so i cant switch grad schools i cant move from this hell hole i tried talking to a therapist they said something about it just being paranoia and threatened to take me off a medication for adhd that i have happily been on for over 6 years because it can increase paranoia i dont understand how being scared to leave my house is paranoia when at least once a week someone says something terrible to me or threatens me i have been mugged twice since i have lived here i feel like my only other option is killing myself i could probably just walk home at night with a purse and end up shot within a month to be completely honest i cant live here anymore

1,help my gf has considered suicide and selfharm in the past hey reddit i have a problem with my girlfriend and for some context were both in high schoollast night my girlfriend asked me if i have ever been suicidal i have never but i immediately felt concerned because i knew where the conversation was heading she revealed to me that she has been suicidal before i asked if she ever selfharmed and she told me she has considered it she said that 3 years ago she felt alone she had a pair of scissors and was thinking about stabbing herself in the stomach at the moment when she told me this i just gave her a big hug and told her that she can always talk somebody and she could talk to me if she ever needed to i honestly didnt know what else to say because we were out on a date and i didnt want to upset her by saying something she might not like even now as i write this i recall her telling me that when she was in elementary she threatened her schoolmates that were bullying her that she would kill herself at the time when she told me this i was shocked but rationalized in my mind that she was probably lying so her bullies would back off she said it in a kind of laughing tone and i assumed stupidly that she was all right she exhibits some signs of depression she asked me if my parents hated her after they met her and she has a pretty low image of her bodythis is where i need some advice i really want to help her out because i really really like her and would never leave her because of something like this ive been reading some of the stuff on but i am not sure whenhow to approach the subject do i just wait for her to bring this up again or should i offer her a chance to talk to me more about this before something serious ever happens thanks in advance

1,just cant handle the anxiety and depression any more my anxiety is so bad that it is nearly crippling i actually felt good last night after so long and i thought i was making some progress new meds lost a little weight cut back on drinking i went to bed last night and i said i was going to have a good day off woke up at six with the anxiety back full force felt like i was going to vomiti am so tired of living like this i just wish i was single with no kids some times so i could just kill myself and not feel this way anymore i cant though becausei amafraid of what it would do to my family
1,my suicide would be justified because of the ways ive hurt the people closest to me we were just 18 years old and i was a selfish and jealous boyfriend i never laid a finger on her but the emotional pain and manipulation i inflicted upon her was clear i was a troll i was a person who felt underappreciated by everyone around me and i turned these feelings into acts of provocation and a boundless sense of entitlement flash forward five years later we have graduated college and we are still together we moved across the country together i have matured ive gained insights about the world around me the struggles of people less fortunate than me and i would like to think that i have become a more empathetic person i have realized i am not the center of the universe the past is all behind us she tells me that the past doesnt matter because i have changed into a better person she thinks the early conflict of our relationship was almost a good thing because it sparked such a significant change in my personality she loves me and i love her and i dont know what i would do if i didnt have her in my life but none of that changes the fact that i am still haunted by the things ive said and done in the past haunted by the person i was in the early days of our relationship how unfathomably selfish i was how i could say and do such vile things to the person who i love more than anything in the world she says i need to stop punishing myself for what ive said and done in the past because all that matters is that i am a good person going forward but i think this is what i deserve this pain that i am writing about is my punishment and i have finally realized iti am not a criminal and i am not a violent person but i still am unable to eat because of a fixation on the past why doesnt her forgiveness satisfy me why do i still feel worthless because of the mean things i did when i was barely a legal adult why hasnt the slate wiped itself clean yet what do i have to doi just know that if i were to leave this earth it would be justifiable as i would never be able to inflict emotional trauma onto another sweet caring person one reason that i havent done it yet is because i know that if i were ever to commit suicide it would give her the same type of emotional trauma that haunts me almost every day and i could never condone that type of action on the person i love most so i guess i am now forced into a life plagued with guilt where i will always have to live with the memories of what a jerk i used to be half a decade ago a life where the high point of my week is embarrassing myself in front of my therapist with incoherent rambling like the kind youre reading right now a life where i take my pills every morning with the futile hope that maybe one day i might not have to feel this way anymore 
1,wondering why life is worth living i have not been diagnosed with depression nor do i think i have depression despite the thoughtsi amhaving however i think my thoughts would be suitable to post in this subreddit since these are the types of things you guys talk about often i havent been hating life but i see no point in it everyone arounds me preaches the gift of life but i dont see how it has any value and death is extremely desirable for me no more worrying or working or feeling bored or feeling sad just nothing i suppose you could consider it ultimate laziness but i see no shame in that i fantasize about death and committing suicide on a regular basis id just be interested in hearing other peoples opinions as to why life has any reason to continue it living so that i can make others happier doesnt count ps a lot of you might recommend that i see a therapist but ive gone over the rules and the law of confidentiality doesnt apply for expressing suicidal thoughts and i dont want my family to be contacted nor do i want to be hospitalised as they phrase it
1,19 yo suicidal girl i dont want to spend 77 years of life battling a cycle of depression and anxiety i just dont wanna be here anymore
1,the conclusion of me the silence is loud louder than anything ive ever heard it pierces my ears and impregnates my mind it tells me about myself i drown it out with the loudest angriest music i know i dont know if i feel emotion anymore i search for the disgusting and disturbing to prod my heart i want it to beat again i want to feel the warmth of my blood flowing through my veins it works for a short period but i amslowly becoming desensitized i shock myself with my own thoughts if the inner workings of my mind are a representation of my soul then i am malevolent i crave violence and hatred i wish i was more hated than i am because then maybe these feelings would be justified but i amloved by all who meet me i hate being loved i deserve nothing and no one to my daughter esli if your mother loves you at all she will find someone worthy of your love and hers and she will omit me from your past i never deserved either of you ive already missed most of your life because of work at this point i wish i could see you go to your first day of school words dont do justice to the amount of love i have for you and your brotherto my son bronson youre not old enough to know me which is fortunate for youi am sorry i will never be there to teach you about life or sports or girls you deserve a much better father than i could ever be your first birthday will be about the timei amsupposed to come home from this deployment i only got you for a month but every second was worth holding you and your sister and seeing you both smile and laugh i love you an unfathomable amountto my wife kristen i took your youth away from you by starting a family with you when we were seventeen and eighteen and making you believe that i was normal for years the three years weve been married were the only times in my life that i felt anything remotely close to happiness this sickness has haunted me since i was a child and i desperately wanted to be a normal happy person but i am too disgusting to deserve that i want you to know that nothing i feel is your fault nor the kids fault its just the cards ive been delt i want you to find someone who will make you happy because you deserve to be happy with someone who is genuinly happy and will dance with you and will be there for the kids instead of being gone for for several months or even a year at a time nothing i could ever do could make me deserve you any of you the guilt i feel for leaving you with a three year old and a six month old may be enough to kill me before i can whatever love ive ever felt has been for you three

1,i just dont feel like living really things are kinda grey and unexciting i can sometimes imagine a good life like i can imagine the life of some celebrity distant not mine but there somehow it used to bother me that i couldnt access it that nothing excites me anymore it feels likei amdragging it out like i played the game and now i scroll back and forth in the creditslist i know that theres a lot i havent seen or experienced but it feels like its not for me it didnt use to be like that there was a time when i was genuinely excited and exciting where i was in awe of what was in front of me and i was willing to struggle for it even though the world looked grey to me friends told me that talking to me was like dreaming how much they loved me etc now i cant bear to see them because i bore them to death i dont have anything to say to them theres nothing i want to share with them and nothing i want to hear from them i got really good at listening and thats what i can do nothing more nothing less i dont even talk to myself i dont have any hopes any dreams left sure i have goals but i dont care about them anymore still all of this feels wrong when i met my stepgrandfather lying fragily on his bed mustering whatever he still had inside of him that his parkinson hadnt destroyed yet to talk to me which he didnt even do when his own children or anyone else came to see him it felt like he passed on his torch to me like he knew what i was capable of and believed in me in a way that makes me a fundamental character in a story to be told id end it immediately if it wasnt for the feeling thati ammissing something that i didnt connect the dots on something that would be my purpose that echoes every so softly deep inside me somewhere even though i dont feel it i dont know i just dont feel really

1,i hate my life and its not that i feel sad its that i feel nothing i feel like the empty shell of a person how i wish i could feel something that i wish i could even feel sad but i feel nothing the only reason i ever really talk to my boyfriend now is to feel sad because at least he makes me feel something it feels like he doesnt love me anymore and he doesnt want to be with me who would ever want to be but i am still so in love with him and the feeling that he doesnt love me back makes me feel pain at least its something i just want him to hold me admire me do something to show i matter to him but i dont get that just emptiness sometimes being around my mom helps i dont have to say anything about how i feel but she knows when i need her it must be some sixth sense shell cook me a warm meal take me shopping do whatever it is to see me feel even a bit more full i dont trust anyone not even my boyfriend i feel like i will be judged or brushed off whenever i try and say something it feels like my throat is closing like my body is physically stopping itself from reaching out no one wants to talk to me either even when they knowi amhiding something it feel like they dont care enough to ask but when they do i feel nothing but judgement and it feels like people are always trying to defend themselves all i want is a wonderfully warm hug someone to hold me and make me feel like nothing else matters a long meaningful hug something to make me feel like the birds are chirping again the rain is falling slower or even just a sign thati am still living not just alive but i am dead inside and i wish to be dead all around i hate my life i hate myself 
1,id rather die in america than be sent back home growing up i always felt like an american i see this country as my home but legally ive never been an american and i know in the eyes of manyi am nothing more than a criminali amaware that i have no future either way but i would much rather die in my real home the us 
1,i need someone to talk to i feel like everyone i meet gives me the cold shoulder my friends seem to just move on without me my contact list is full but nobody wants me to be their friendi am not even a back up plan everyone else always has plans families relationships i try new hobbies and try to met nee people but everyone seems to not care about me as much as i care about them my story is so sad what do i do i know i need help
1,i made too many bad choices to recover the bad choices i made in life were not obviously bad choices prioritize school over your social life major in a stem field dont work a parttime job if you dont need the money not joining a frat not being a social butterfly changing my major etc all of this has added up to me being 26 and living in my parents basement while my friends are living fun lives awesome apartments great jobs and cute girlfriends even making some of the right choices like getting a summer internship being actively involved in an engineering design team and participating in class hasnt mitigated this i have over a dozen references who would speak the world of my work ethic intelligence and enthusiasm but it doesnt matter because most employers dont bother to check them until they made a decision at the airbnb house there are a ton of girls having fun all probably around my age working in 5570kyear easy prevent planning jobs all because they either knew how to sell themselves or knew someone within my small network doesnt afford me any leads so i am stuck with online applications which yields some dozen interviews but mostly companies who decide to pass me on because i am not 100 perfect candidate with 6 years of experience even if i did get job that even just pays above 45kyear it will still be hard to develop a ton of good friendships like people do in college and high school even harder to find a quality girl since most relationships are formed through mutual friends at one point i had a knife to my chest but was too afraid to go through with it on the other hand a quick painful death would be better than a slow prolonged torture 
1,its over ive decided ive given up thank you reddit for being my only happiness though what time i had thank you see ya later
1,ive pushed everyone away and its all my fault i honestly dont know how i got to this point but on the surface things seem to be going well i got good marks last semester and i joined a good number of clubs and volunteered in things that i enjoyed except school just started up again and i have no friends in any of my classes of my current friends theyre all too busy with their coursework to strike up a conversation the same could be said of me except i just feel like nobody gives a shit about what i have to say anymore since ive just burdened them with my venting beforehand i honestly started enough fights with my friends online that some have started to stop talking to me granted i apologized excessively they wont even acknowledge me in the hallway anymore i honestly think its my fault for all of this my depressive mood swings have honestly done enough damage to my friendshipsim just fed up with life because i knowi amjust going to end up just studying hard and accepting my circumstance thati am in i know that even if i continue to get these good marksi amjust going to be as miserable as i am moving oni amhonestly just sad since its just me playing games after a night of hard worki amjust so alone now fuck junior year so far even though it just started fuck man this rant has been too long and incoherent and quite franklyi am sorry for wasting your time if youre still reading

1,might delete later i just wanted to say something some weeks ago it can be months time is going on so fucking fast lately its scary i said that the only reason to keep living was sex that immediate satisfaction you get and nothing else is real or really worth it and when sex doesnt fill you up any more then its time to go because there is nothing left i did not think the time would come so fast i thought it might be years and years of trying to get a normal life untili amtotally drained of sexual desire and by that time i would have kids and i dont want to kill myself if i have kids but no it only took some weeks whatever i still do is just me trying to get back to better times but there is always something missing its obvious that whats old doesnt work anymore but i cant think of anything new i might have reached the epitome of creativity at 1718 awesome and i amlost i couldnt be more lost and its scary i see everyone finding their place in the world and their passion and where they belong and i have nothing of thati amjust walking alone and the people that should support me the most make me feel bad for it and i dont know how much more i will be able to stand it and now i look at the two people i still take three buses and pretend that i dont hate my life for and i want to hug them and tell them that they will be everything they want to be and more because they have something to live for because theyre good and their smiles are so sincere and heart warming because they belong somewhere because they dont cry at 6 am writing suicidal things in reddit i hope they dont really mean it if they do so if i decide to really do it because i feel like there is nothing else to live for because the pressure is too high here and i can hardly breathe and death would be such a relief i just want them to know how much theyre appreciated and how i thought about them in my last times them and a couple of artists i listen to everyday and love thanks for coming into my life and i dont care if you fight you make my days better and you give me a reason to do one of the few things i enjoy that is singing

1,my suicidalty is genuinely the most positive part of my life i am not depressed i am currently healthy both physically and mentally and yet my constant thoughts of self harm and suicide are just as strong as they have been for the entirety of my waking life and i am super happy about themive made a few posts on here about how i was confused and irritated by them in the past but after having some time to rest and recuperate i feel completely sold by my thoughts to end my life i feel like my body should logically be destroyed and its now pretty much objectively the right idea for me whether that is by my own hand or in a situation where someone else kills me if someone pulled a gun to me and shot right now i would feel pretty content about my painful end to my life and it saves me the effort of doing it myselflife is really fun and i enjoy the company of my friends as well work is satisfying too but none of it is such that i need to carry on living to see or do any more of it i just feel satisfied in what i have to do to myselfi guess the only reasoni amstaying around is that it is currently a right faff for me to die right now i got a couple if boring things to get organised and then i will be free to do whateveri know it feels weird me posting this reasonably inspiring story on here but i guess its just that i want to vocalise it around people who wouldnt be immediately weirded out or just mindlessly telling me to call a suicide hotline also i feel its nice to let the community that allowed me to be comfortable and happy with my suicidalty know about where i got in the endthanks for the help 
1,life will never satisfy me ive suffered too much goodbye

1,ive stopped myself from ending it tonight the rope still sits around my neck and my note is written outi amjust feeling like shit thats all i can say ive got loads of things that i can mention and i can write all things thats wrong with my life and feel sorry about myself for a bit but in all honesty i just feel crap ive felt like crap for years but i finally want to give upi am tired of being tired all the timei amsick of being angry and depressed with life i just want it to end but yet again i stopped myself because the overwhelming feeling of guilt what id do to the people i left behind but its getting to the point where i want to be selfish i want to just think about myself for once and finally be at peace
1,i can feel myself slipping away again i tried killing myself almost half a decade ago but it didnt work out the way i wanted it too honestlyi amthankful for all the extra time that ive had there were lots of good memories that i wouldnt have gotten to have if i had died that night and great people that id have never knownbut i still feel the same way i did before its been sitting in the back of my mind all this time sometimes barely noticeable and other times almost consuming my thoughts but always there and nowi amfinding myself winding down the same fucking path as last time pushing people away spending all my time alone slowly losing all motivation to carry on living an okay life and theres no reason for it nothing set it off theres been no noticeable change in my life up until i started slipping away and its going to ruin meive never wanted to kill myselfi amscared by the idea of it but i have wanted to die for as long as i can remember and i know that i can go through with it with a lot more success than last time but ive been holding on and i am going to keep holding on as long as i can because part of me hopes that if i just wait my mood will come around again and balance itself out like it usually does i feel likei amrambling but i dont have many people in my life i can be open to about this sort of thing and typing all of this out has been a little therapeutic thank you for reading this
1,why shouldnt i just do it i cant find any reason not to kill myself except that it would be selfish and might hurt people around me but that doesnt make sense why should i care for people around me and stick around living in my own shell of fears and pain and not listen that whisper in the back of my mind telling me everyday to just slit my wrist why why shouldnt i just listen to that voice why do i have to care about what other people would feel when i decide to end my life

1,how to help a severely depressedsuicidal friend my best friend tried to kill himself 3 months ago he struggles with depression but once medicated can be fine for years on end he takes breaks from his medication occasionally to prove to himself he doesnt need it to function its worked a few times where hes unmedicated for a few years with no problems this last bout of depression without medication ended with him taking a cocktail of pills we found him in time and took him to the er the only way for him to be released on his own recognizance as opposed to being committed to a state run facility was to go back on medication and follow a strict outpatient program with counselingtherapyhe was doing so great for a few months i was super happy he spoke positively about therapy and really seemed to have a new outlook on life hes got an incredibly supportive network of friends and family lately he seems to have fallen back into the behavior patterns leading up to the suicide attempt isolation canceling clients at work self employed small business owner staying up all night doing cocaine etc i just cant understand why with all the positive changes he made after his attempt this is happening again hes always managed fine on medication previously which makes me wonder if hes even taking it regularly long story short hes pushing me away and i am so so worried that another attempt is imminent i dont know how to handle it or what to say or do i give him his space and offer to listen if and when he feels like talking i just feel like its not enough and i amscared to death of losing my best friend thanks for any advice

1,amstuck in this placei ama ghosti aminvisible to most of the people at my school only a few acknowledge my presence and even fewer people talk to me i feel forgotten everyone is out having fun with each other and here i am on my couch typing this while listening to music i wish everyone at my school wasnt fake acting like people dont exist until they cant take it and kill themselves or die unexpectedly ive seen it all ive seen it with two people and only one is still brought up its because he was in a club at my school the other is probably forgotten by everyone elsei amprobably going to leave tonight if i do i want those at my school youll know who you are to not be begging for attention because the two guys i normally hang out with are the only ones allowed to say that or i just want everyone else to not feel like what i have ive always been alienated by most of you those who knew me know ive been bullied just know i remembered you all to the very end i guess i could have buried the hatchet and let some things go but i didnt i dont want my funeral to be in a church i want to have it somewhere outside big enough to have at least twenty or thirty people but have enough room for more if necessary i dont want anyone just sitting and having a pity party for me i want you all to talk about their favorite stories of mei amprobably going to be online for another hour or so to make up my mind one last time feel free to talk to me if i decide not to tonight at least i will update the post edit i know i said an hour or so but i thinki am going to sleep on it tonight and see how i feel when the morning comes
1,am doing it tomorrow i have nothing to lose from a suicide attempt even if i become paralysedi live a boring live inside a house for the last 3 years and i hate most peoplei have really nothing to lose except my chainsto be honest becoming paralysed is better than working everyday from 95 i dont care about my familyi look them in eyes and tell them i will start working tomorrow but i will commit suicide
1,inch by inch have started to put it all together practicing some going through the steps making sure all goes well no surprises etc except the last step obviously since i am writing this surprised with the lack of emotions or drama i thought i would be scared or nervous or crying or sad but i am not not at all when the time comes i really believe it is going to be as easy has feeding yourself scratching an itch or putting on a shirt something you just do without thinking you just do it without a thought i am genuinely surprised with this revelation almost let down lol i am not delusional i know exactly what is happening and that i am marching towards something that is going to bring a huge amount of pain to people around me something where there is always a possibility of solving some time in the future that little light of hope is no longer good enough i dont care about possibilities anymore i want something more absolute i want something more concrete i am tired of putting forth effort and not getting anything for it and the thought of well keep trying one day it will be ok is no longer good enough i have pretty much done it all to try and fix myself and have had zero positive results not even close to being ok it is a huge disappointment i am so tired of trying that i no longer want to put forth any effort especially more effort into things i have done over and over and over for years i do wish there was something no psychologist has ever told me something ground breaking a light bulb moment that changes my life forever etc but they are all the same and say the same shit i have zero drive left all used up either a miracle happens in the next 4 months or lights out i thought my family would be enough to keep me holding on and it was for a lot of years but it isnt anymore sure i love them and they love me but love of others is not enough when you have nothing in your life to give you meaning and the feeling of accomplishment i am literally just taking up space now 
1,lmao were all done here no onem i was hoping but ids okkdoing wellthank you

1,nothing will ever be ok it might i cant promise you that it will but i can say it can happen i know that sometimes it seems like the dark lasts forever and that light at the end of the tunnel is going to be the train that runs us over but sometimes it really is the sunlight and we can go into it please dont do anything harmful find someone to talk to something to distract you dont hurt yourself okay

1,more of a confession than a cry for help i amwas decide for yourself i guess a sadistic psychopath i felt no emotion for anyone it was all emulated i was a flawless liar and no one ever suspected i was anyone other than who i presented as i hated most people and it made me happy to see them suffer ive never physically harmed anyone but i have ruined peoples lives for no reason other than malicei amalso a longtime user of this sub and frequently preyed upon those seeking help on here via pm i suspect some of them killed themselves because of me it wasnt my specific intention but it gave me an unrivaled feeling of satisfactioni was also a very reckless and selfdestructive person without fear i would do anything just for the experience without worrying about the consequences the law of averages caught up to me and i made the mistake that i think is going to end me i decided to transition into a woman for at the time fetishistic reasons using hormones i lied my way through potential gatekeeping told them i had dysphoria my whole life and all that it was easy a few weeks after starting hormones things got weird and only got weirder the longer it went on firstly i was always planning to kill myself while quite young because i felt like my existence was wrong it was a very vague feeling but it was intense and i had no fear of death so i just decided i would kill myself whenever life stopped being fun very quickly that feeling went away the next change was i started developing emotionally a full range of emotions i had never experienced i always thought i was very good at managing my emotions but i think i just never had any emotions to manage this wasis quite overwhelming the change that seems like its going to be my downfall is my developing emotional empathy i started to care about people and their struggles even random strangers it felt so good i would go to bad neighborhoods and give money to homeless people sit with them and listen to them talk about their lives it made me happy to make them happy and thinking about their pain hurt me i feel likei amfinally turning into a complete person i didnt understand how empty i was because i never had anything to compare it toalong with this emotional empathy though was something else that i think wont stop escalating until i either kill myself or have a psychotic break i started to feel guilty about the kind of person i was before and what i did and it keeps getting worse and its already unbearable on top of this ive started getting flashbacks of childhood trauma and my sanity is slipping rapidly i want to kill myself again for these new reasons but hilariously there are people in my life i now care about who would be crushed if i did if anything can be described as poetic justice its this i imagine i could detransition but i never want to go back to how i was physically or mentally i dont expect sympathy or even belief from anyone but i wanted to type this out anywayi am sorryi am sorry for everything i never want to hurt anyone ever again i wish i had never hurt anyone i wish i could take it all back but i cant and nothing i can do will ever make up for it and i am sorry this guilt is destroying me and i cant express how sorry i am

1,not all that bad if you die i am quite damaged i find joys upon upon other ppl misfortune as long as i deem it not serious enough i dont care about anyone not even myself on my worse days and theres worst sometimes i got fixated on problems that will resolve with time but until then i cease to be productive and functional i have no energy to pursue things that i love theres a part of my brain that makes excuse at every opportunity that comes and gone and theres so many i got trapped both in the past and future the ghosts of yesteryear in the prison of tomorrow you can t escape the past demons but you can outrun your fate and thus in wanting to do so i become suicidal the ability to control your own fate by ending it at any time becomes too enticing to given up or maybe that s what fate has installed for me that i ll kill myself someday hopefully soon enough jokes on them though i wont be able to give a fuck if i just die out of this plane of existence please no other plane of consciousness or else the curse of being sentient for eternity would suck so bad the false i willusion of freedom is one of the worst thing imaginable your future is locked into a fix state and you can t seem to change it no one can see the walls around you except yourself you go around trying to find a way to tear it down but the walls impede your effort you realize that the source of the walls is yourself as long as you re here the walls will be there you then know one way to crash it all down but the opportunity has not presented itself just yet yeah not just yet but it will someday in a form of a gunit s hard to stay positive and think long term when i cant see what over the horizon actually that s not true i do see something all the roads lead to rome and all i see is a bullet through the temple of my head that s all i see the end of the road and theres nothing after it i want to get there so so bad though can ramble for quite a bit here but nobody cares enough for that basically i feel lifeconsciousness is a prison and i want a way out theres nothing interesting here or to be more precise theres nothing as exciting as no longer have to think about anything forever people keep saying life is a gift i say fuck that the one true gift is freedom the most intrinsic part of it robbing people their ability to end their lives is the cruelest of cruel crime

1,suicide is logical ive had suicidal thoughts since age sixi amsuccessful accepted which as a transwoman is amazing independent and working in a job i love but everyday it feels like suicide is logical suicide is painless it eases stress and allows rest yes suicide is permanent and i know that stress is temporary but i am tired of the constant cycle of fighting suicidal thoughts it sucks that my first thought when pulling up on a traffic jam is is there a way to slam into the trick without harming others it sucks that my brain jumps to suicide regardless of situationi am tired of fighting the thoughts it feels like the thoughts are destined to win i keep trying to identify little things to live for but nothing really matters long term i could die and the world continue to go on with one less waste of life on it i have a plan and that scares me
1,they say it will end soon but the torture is the process
1,i thought college would make things betteri amaway at college and i had nothing back home until a year ago i was able to escape from my abusive home life and my trauma related to being molested as a kid through dance my dance teacher became the father i wish i had and i got other mentors along the way too i even met bill clinton at one of my performances which was in front of hundreds of people and also got to perform at madison square garden but dont get me wrong life was still hard i still wanted to kill myself i started fall in love this summer and now he wont talk to me anymore and i had no closure because i was never given a concrete reason he was the first boy ive met who has treated me how i deserve to be treated and now hes in a different country and it hurts when i think about him and i amwearing the necklace he wore right now and its the only thing that makes me feel safe sometimes i also lost control and started harming more this summer but nobody knows that because even though i know its a good idea to get help reporting this means being in more college debt and suffering at the hands of my family for longer soi am trying to power through if getting help was a rational option i would go for it but then i go to college and its great here because i dont have to regularly interact with the people who molested me and my horrible disgusting excuses for parents as much but my plans fell through and i was misinformed about the dance opportunities available for me on campus long story short theres a possibility i wont even be able to take ballet let alone hip hop which is what i took back home and what helped me through dark times and i hurt my ankles so i cant even dance in my free time just for fun for likely another week at least the only true friends ive ever had in the long term are back home my mentors back home told me to call them when i got to college but most of them wont even answer my texts i get that theyre busy theyre talent managers and directors and choreographers and higher ups in the business but they are also the first people ive ever been able to deem real family and we have a deep bond they are the reason i am who i am today and want to kill myself much less often than before especially my dance teacher often whenever we said goodbye to each other we would hug and say i love you but now he doesnt even text me to say he cant talk on the phonei am not being clingyi am trying not to be a bother but i just need them right now is just wanting to say hi from time to time irrational i feel likei amlosing everyone all over again this shit has happened twice before i have quality friends back home that have changed my life but i am not comfortable telling them about how i have been abused and how the boy i love and who loveor maybe loved depending on the reason why hes done this stopped looking me in the eye soi amjust kind of here in college and honestly i had a tough night i tried out for dance team and i did horribly and hurt my ankles so thats another door closed with dance and also i did a tibetan bowl meditation and if any of you guys dont understand meditation just know that this specific kind often lets you see visions and i had a really depressing vision having to do with the boy i love it had to do with me re meeting a night recently where i was outside in the cold for 3 hours calling anyone i could think of to talk to them about how much i was hurting but nobody answered until the very end of the night i called all my mentors and still none of them have texted me saying sorry they missed my call and people here at college are nice so much nicer than the people i regularly interact with back home but they dont know me well enough to understand just exactly how this is all tearing at the seemsi thought college would be a better place for me and it was at first but after tonight its safe to say that even though some things got better it evened out cuz now a lot do other things are getting worse i havent let myself self harm in the last few days but its really hard not to i dont really see a reason to keep going anymore and i am really good at finding reasons to keep going if things are gonna be like this for the next four years i dont wanna stick around because by the time it does get better i will be too fucked in the head to appreciate it i wont kill myself tonight cuz i never do cuzi am too scared but i amafraid thati amgonna hurt myself and get yet another scar and i get really sad when i look at my self harm scars they are all from this summer i dont really want to be alive right now sometimes i feel like the only way my dance teacher would send me a message is if he found out i tried to hurt myself and thats what makes this so tempting the people i miss would actually talk to me more if they heard about me trying to kill myself i dont want to make them sad because i love them but i am so fucking desperate just to get a hello how are youi am sorry i havent bothered to reply to your messages but i still love youi amwilling to go to great lengthsi amscared of myself right now i know these are toxic thoughts but honestlyi am so desperate to talk to the people i love that trying to end my life is starting to seem worth it 
1,i am a lair i seem like i am the most put together person when really i am decaying i am the person my friends and family for advice and help i always help them with anything i am the person that seems like i have it all figured out and i am so happy but i am dying inside i feel so lonely and isolated from any true connection i cannot turn to my friends because i am their rock at the moment and my step mother my rock will just judge me and make me breakdown i know that if i didnt seem this way more so i feel like if i dont seem valuable to my friends and family they will drop me mostly because it has happened my family has taught me that it is weak to have these thoughts and i should just suck it up but i have been doing that for years and the thoughts are like waves and crash hard at times drown me i dont want to die but i dont want to wake up i dont want this false sense of the happy life i am not happy i am 20 fat and weird i am creeping this poor guy i am into out because i am so flipping desperate for a human connection that isnt fake i come off desperate

1,the first day of senior year truly made me realize how lonely i am i beat depression but it came back this summer senior year began today and it really showed how lonely i am an even smaller circle of friends this year people i used to talk to ignoring me on purpose i dont want to go on like this itll only get more painful than it already is i cant embrace the life of loneliness i want something i can never achieve because of some stupid reason society overvalues like my looks the only answer i have is maintaining my hatred for everyone else who ignores me and school in general or committing suicide to take myself out of the misery 
1,why does life feel like a movie that has been on for way too long i dont feel like killing myself as much as i just feel disappointed by life itself nothing is new or exciting nothing is stimulating everything feels like it is either predictable or simply happens for little to no reason how do people get fulfillment from existing like this how are people able to build relationships with one another when there are so many obvious flaws to life that have simple solutions but will never actually come to light all memes aside i feel like i am taking crazy pills and like i am the only person still actually paying attention to whats going on around them as arrogant as that sounds what the fuck is this world and why is it so void of reason

1,i really dont know what to do next hello i have to turn to you because i genuinely feel like ive lost all hope and reason to really stay alivei am16 years old and have been heavily depressedsuicidal for a good 4 years now i struggle immensely with aspergers and social anxiety and that has hindered me severely with trying to fit in or be normal i was in a lot of discontent with my life but i managed believing that i could just soldier on and almost suck it up in a sense however when i finished high school i had a lot of time to think and reflect and to be quite honest with you it has really accentuated how utterly dull and mundane everything around me has become food doesnt taste as great music doesnt sound as great nothing feels like its good anymore i debated very heavily to end my life but in all honesty i really dont want to fucking die when it chooses to life can be such a wonderful place filled with joy and beauty and substance but that euphoria has become very short and very far apart i recently started higher education to try and maybe get some purpose in my life or try and distract myself from the sadnesssuicidal thoughts by being a more academic person but that in term made it a lot worse because it again acted as a catalyst that reminded me at how awkward i really am i feel really dumb because i cant really concentrate much in lessons and therefore i miss out on a lot of learning i feel really anxious because i always feel like people are looking at me and judging me and every time i walk past someone laughing i instantly assume its about me i feel overwhelmed because everything caught up with me very quickly and i feel like my sadness is starting to eat away at any chance of getting better i tried professional help but it didnt work and it made me feel worse about myself because i felt like a big burden to my familyi really have no fucking idea what to do sw i really want to live and be content with everything but the sheer idea of things being the way they are makes me so very depressed that its starting to affect my physical health too my hair is falling in clumps my skin looks like utter shiti amsteadily gaining weight my self esteem is dropping to basically nothing i always feel tired and unmotivatedim just so sick of it all if you read this far then thank you and i hope you havehad a wonderful day

1,_________ _____ have you ever loved someone you didnt know very wellim the only fool who does everything about this man makes my abdomen cramp up when i feel hes near and when he smiles its like hes opened up a bright new world he has the sexiest tone of voice ive ever heard so calm and soothing and warmest demeanor to where i dont even feel cold anymore i wanted to know everything about this man i mean even if he gained 400 pounds i would still love him even if he lost his limbs i would chop mine off and offer it right up to him he probably wouldnt take it even if he couldnt use his spine and lost all uses of his lower body i would take care of him because i love his demeanor his spirit his attitude his insides his voice i wish i could be his shadow i would sacrifice my own happiness just to see that big bright smile just to see him reveal a new world to me i would trade my life for his and my soul would be up for sale to the most sinister deity but i am too dark too tall my hair feels like a brillo padi am too uglyi ampoor i just want to crawl inside myself and die and come back as someone he deservesi amjust a dog barking here because no one will listen in real lifei amjust a stalker a loser degenerate freak who doesnt even deserve to live no one will read this but if there is one i know youll ask wheres your self esteem 
1,oh where to begin ive been plagued by mental health issues pretty much since birth this caused an enormous amount of strain on me and my family and made me an outcast from early childhood and gained a reputation of weird out there bad ect from people who knew absolutely nothing about me but i just shrugged it off and kept on going then in middle school i started getting bullied couldnt walk down the hallway without getting called a faggot and it being middle school the rumors about me just flew like crazy then i was homeschooled in 7th grade because of the bullying and the rumors took on a whole new level of crazy and just flat out bullshit but i just kept goingand then in 8th grade i went back to school and finally made friends people still had all kinds of bullshit ideas about me without ever even having a conversation about me but i actually made friendsthen in high school everything got better at first i had tons of friends who i considered family i wasnt being bullied to my face and i was actually happythen my second year of high school started and boom insomnia i became extremely irritable i was sleeping in class wasnt shaving dressing like shit and so on well i didnt know this at the time but my cyclothymia lesser version of bipolar disorder had kicked into 12th gear what makes matters worse is i was already seeing a shrink and psychiatrist so i was getting medication but can you guess what meds i was getting just antidepressants and for those who dont know ads cyclothymia or bipolar disorder in my case hypomania what fun basically for 3 years i was mostly hypomanici amsure you can all guess what this was like well since one of the symptoms of hypomania is arrogance this got mistook for narcissism and a certain true narcissist didnt like this so he went around to all my friends who i considered family and told them i was this horrible person who thought all of them were less than me which of course i didnt i saw almost all of them as my equal and then it gets better he decided to assume that i was also a liar because i mentioned that i fell into a firepit when i was a kid and melted my hand together but theres no scar so i must be lying even tho it did really happen i will find a way to prove it to you if you dont believe me he told everyone this so practically overnight my family was gone my insomnia had gotten to the point where i was staying awake from 81 straight hours and to cope i turned to xanax and benadryl to sleep the fallout is obvious soi amleft alone addicted to xanax going fucking mad from sleep deprivation and i dropped out of high school 9 months later i had a nervous breakdown cyclothymia progressed to full blown bipolar disorder i start flying off the handle and punching holes in walls smoking tons of weed to cope struggling with xanax and ativan and i have no one not a single personwhats the point none of you will read this far down my rambling to read this i ruined everything but noi amapparently not allowed to be happy or have friends i just ruin everything
1,living life is pointless and not worth the effort soon i will be dead i wont allow my self happiness because its all lies
1,i just dont know who else to talk to i m trying to not kill myself it is hard
1,youll never know when waking up everyday to be that better person keeps draining your inner motivation to do anything in this pointless world look to any other human beside you and realize they may feel the exact same way ive had suicidal thoughts for years its been bad these past couple months although it never looked less appealing to me as to when my buddy purposely crashed his car on the highway in efforts to kill himself hours before i found out about the incident i had been under the assumption that this lady killer of a handsome man had been happy all along and living life to the fullest which i had been jealous of for some time we all have the inner dialogue but if you make the effort to keep pushing on one more day then youre still playing the game maybe the levels get easier as time moves on best of luck to you live life until you feel alive do not lose yourself on this journey

1,just want someone to care before school started i was really confident and knew what i was doing now a month later i am seriously considering killing myself the only thing really stopping me is fear and my family at this point i feel likei am not useful for anything i barely have a place among my friends and only get invited to places because i dont talk much mostly listeni am not attractive my grades are starting to slip not very good at a lot of things either not sure where all my confidence went but i just want this to be over suicide or getting over it i think it mightve started at the realization that no one actually cares a lot for me sure my parents care but it feels like they dont understand and would just try to force religion down my throat anyway ive never had a best friend girlfriend or anyone who actually asks howi am doing starting to think the world easily forget mesorry if it got off topic this has been building up for awhile
1,72 hour holds are bullshit do they think they are helping by forcing you into a hospital do they think they are helping by threatening you do they think they are helpful when they are lying to you when you get 5 different stories from 5 different people on what is about to happen to you if that ever happens again the cops will have to shoot me dead to get me in that ambulance wont be easy becausei amwhite but if i threaten them with a big knife that should do it fuck 72 hour holds ive never known anyone that this helped and a lot of people myself included that it harmed 
1,i dont know what to do i just feel so helpless my problems aint such as no money unemployed having a disability its just my family and surroundingsi amunder 18 and even tho my monthly income would be enough to live alone i cant sincei amunder 18 my parents are treating me horrible and give me the feeling to kill myself every day and i am really close to it everydayi am in work i just love to stay there since i know i dont need to see my parents there sadly my father works at the same company so he visits me sometimes and just make me feel worse in front my work matesi am not sure if he doesnt know how bad of a father he is but he just doesnt seem to know he things hes doing the best even tho he just makes me want to kill myself added to that my parents are extremly intolerant to unnormal things like not being born in the same country we live ineven tho theyre not themselve different sexual orientation and so on being a bisexual guy doesnt benefits any of that everytimei amoutside with my parents and they see someone who doesnt behave like a normal guy or girl they just talk hours about i will they are and weird making me feel even worse my internet access is capped as well i have none at phone and none at my computeri am not allowed to go outside of the city and if i leave the house in my spare time they always question it and want to know exactly where i am and why or dont allow me go at all i just want my own life my own decisions and if i dont manage to live alone and end up killing myself i will at least know its my fault and i fucked up
1,i dont know where else to go i dont know anything anymore other than cops are going to kill me they tased and beat me in a restaurant about two months ago and i may be losing my mind i am just the asshole that no one gives a shit about the truth of the matter is that they saw me and had already made the decision to fuck with me i probably fucked up your life in some way and i know that love isnt enough to fix a fucking thing whichever one of them pulls the trigger is doing a bigger mercy for me than theyll ever know which is why i know i wont do it myself
1,feeling worthless as another birthday is coming up i will first start off by saying that i do have thoughts of suicide but not thoughts of going through it just ways of starting with that saidi am not in a state of mind where id follow through with any of the thoughts id understand if this post isnt allowed for that reason i am feeling worthless however i will be 25 in a few days with absolutely nothing to show for it ive went to college for a year trucking school for about 67 months have had 2 jobs with 1 being for about 3 weeks and the other being 2 days bottom line is i quit everything and now its left me trapped turning 25 with barely any experience or anything i also have a school loan from trucking school for 3 grand that isnt very much compared to other school loans but it sure is when you arent making anything the problem is that i have a mild stutter which makes interviews really difficult to get through especially if i get nervous for that reason i didnt even apply for a job for about 6 months due to just giving up a few months back i said fuck all of that and started applying to places got a few interviews but nothing turned out then i got a job from a temp agency which was the job i quit in two days so nowi amright back where i started its just a horrible feeling watching other people from your class in high school starting to graduate college starting to advance in their careers and such while i have absolutely nothing i really want to be a meteorologist as ive always been obsessed with that sort of thing but i need a job to be able to pay for gas and such to even go to school the locationi am in is really crappy for job opportunities as the closest decent sized town is 2030 minutes away so its not likei am in a city with tons of job openings or anything i dont really know what kind of advicei am looking for but i feel like getting everything off my chest is a great start

1,am i a coward for not killing myself yet as the title says am i being too much of a coward about this i have been thinking of committing suicide for 2 months now but i cant seem to do it i have a mother who i know just wants the best out of me but the words that she says to me makes me think that she doesnt care about me at all i have friends but i cant even determine if they are truly my friends or just a bunch of fakes i get bullied in school almost every single day video games are the only thing that makes the pain go away but i get addicted my grades have plummetted and i cant even see clearly now i know that people will just say just look at the homeless people you have it better than them but money cant buy happinessi amno longer happy i spend my time at school depressed and when i get home i have a mother who constantly scolds me for nothing but even if they are like that i still think to myself if my pain right now will carry on to someone else or they would not even care if i disappeared from this world would they even care if i hang myself right now i know that it could cause more pain to them thani amexperiencing right now because they will lose their son so basically the only thing that is keeping me from committing suicide is fear
1,i really dont want to live lets start off by sayingi ama teenager ive had moments of happiness sadness everything many times i felt suicidal but today just takes the cake recently i started high school i had one friend in the class i was in yet i decided to change the class so i could be with a friend that i was in class in middle school well i changed the class and he treats me like dust like i dont exist i cant believe this i made my situation from bad to terrible i had one friend to talk to now i have literally none all day in school alone i dont thinki amable to change the class again because you need a replacement person to take the place this really might seem like a minor thing youll make friends in the new class no i wont its full of scum and i have 4 years of this everyday in front of me i left the school early because i wanted to cry and i wasnt able to sit there any longer i had a mental breakdown today and stood on the train tracks thinking if i should end it i decided not then i go back to my house and it appears the teacher called my mom there i had an argument with her i thought that it would get better but it didnt it seems like no one cares about what i feeli amcompletely alone now and this really makes me want to put an end to this in the end we all will die so its basically like a shortcut i dont know i really dont its such a simple thing to fix just change my class back to the old one but these pieces of shit teachers dont give a single fuck about it fuck this shit man

1,day 2 curly hair i have beautiful curly hair i never really saw how nice it was until later on in my life when i saw other women of colour rock their curls they were so healthy and bouncyas a child i grew up in a predominantly caucasian town there was one afrocentric boy at my elementary school and one other mixed girl her mix however is japanese and british my mix is irish and bajan my mother never really knew how to take care of my hair as i grew older my grandmother told me to cut my hair thats not true though it was my father who told me to cut my hair i dont know why i stuck to that story for so longi was often bullied for my skin colour my hair i couldnt understand it i didnt get the joke or that i was the joke my mother is a blonde with green eyes i myself have green eyes and brown hair my skin is not very dark yet i was always compared to shiti remember a girl hit me and pulled my finger back as i rose my hand to answer a question i cried of course and when the teacher asked her why her response was as simple as shes different than when i tried to point out the prejudice in her statement i was scolded and sent back to the classroomanyways i later permed my hair straightened it and it was destroyed short dry hair finally into my adult life about 20 years of age i decided to grow it it took a long while for it to repair itselfi wore my hair down at work today threw together the shaggiest outfit in existence paired it with some two dollar flip flops and headed outmy day was the same nothing eventful or new one coworker even said to me you look like you got smashed last night however towards the end of the day many of the girls were complimenting my hair saying how healthy it looked i became really self conscious after thati hate standing out i fidgeted with my hair all the way home i thought my hair looked ugly that day but they kept saying how pretty it wasit adds to me feeling like everything is fake or my perception is incredibly flawed it was comparable to when you see a very fat person and tell them they are fit like its a lieanyways acceptance from my peers or compliments doesnt change anything i still feel so blurryon the upside i finally have beautiful curly hair6 days and counting
1,how to actually stop myself i dont care any more because of being high apparently it was too much to ask to be born into this world without being mutilated within weeks it was too much to ask to have a therapist who didnt do things to me before i finished puberty it was too much to ask to live a car crash that should have killed me and instead left me like this invalid piece of shit i am

1,hopeless i had a falling out with some friends at the beginning of the year and have only talked to them intermittently since a few weeks ago i was shown screenshots of them trash talking me for something that was out of my control and because i apparently started the arguement again two of them have cut ties with me entirelywhat did i do wrong i never mentioned anything to them i didnt even confront them about the messages why does it even hurt we havent spoken for over a month i shouldnt carejust 8 months of hating myself for not having the courage to talk to them has lead to this and i feel fucking hopeless

1,both my parents tried to kill themselves last week craziest week of my whole life was called at 4 am that my parents where both rushed to the hospital because they tried to kill themselves this whole situation thats basically flipped my life upside down
1,tried to kill myself and failed last night i tried to kill myself i had been planning to do so for awhile and finally built up to courage to take the plunge my method of choice was oxycodone my mom had a whole bunch from a shoulder surgery that she didnt take some were 5mg and a few were 10mgi havent taken any oxycodone other than when i had my wisdom teeth out 15 years ago so my tolerance was literally zero i didnt count how many i took but based on how many were left vs how many i had when i started i believe that i consumed about 65mg in a single dosei am not a big guy about 165lbs or so i know that people take way more than that throughout a days doseage but thats after having built up a solid tolerance and admittedly i hadnt done much research on how much shouldve been enough to kill me but i remembered seeing somewhere that 40mg can be lethal for someone with no tolerance so i thought it wouldve been enough sincei am not a very big guy and i didnt really eat anything that day what i hopedexpected would happen was that i would pass out unconscious and stop breathing boy was i wrongi simply laid down on my bed kept my eyes closed and waited to die i kept thinking about my dogs that i missed so much and trying to relax and let sleep take me away but it didnt work out like that i felt the dizziness kick in went through periods of profuse sweating all over my body my whole body became quite itchy my breathing became very laboured my heart was pounding uncontrollably after longer than i expected i opened my eyes to look at the clock i couldnt see what time it was and the blurred light appeared to be bouncing up and down the slightest movement resulted in the world swirling slowly around me like swinging a cloth underwater i didnt try to stand but i know that if i did i wouldve fallen straight to the floor i just closed my eyes again and laid there and waited id like to point out that despite all of the physical effects i was feeling my mind was unaltered throughout this entire processit turns out i laid there for at least 5 or 6 hours straight sweating shaking dizzy itchy taking long deep breaths it was absolute hell the whole reasoni amposting this here is because of one very important part of all of this youve probably heard that happens before and i guess its true as soon as i realized holy shit i took the pills this is for real ive really done it i started having 2nd thoughts and debated picking up the phone and trying to call 911 i didnt but it made the experience even more gruellingso all of those hours later i guess i ended up finally falling asleep and i woke up feeling like tremendous shit i vomit at any point during the experience which was one thing i was worried about in terms of failing but i am still dizzy my legs are wobbly and ive only briefly left my bed all day i havent really eaten much except a couple granola bars some water and a cup of coffeeif any of you are thinking about taking pills to end your life its not a peaceful pleasant experience its an absolute nightmarei am still depressed and i still feel deep down like i want my life to end i just wanted to share my experience in case somebody might see it and think twice

1,is it inevitable i am extremely worried for a friend she has a degenerative disease with chronic pain being a major symptom 5 years ago she was relatively normal girlthese days she can barely go out sometimes she is too fatigue to even walk a block she has been on long term disability for almost 2 years the disease is getting worse and depression has been significant and worsening the meds she has to take to control her disease impair her so much she maybe has a few ok hours a day best case scenarioshe has a therapy dog which has been a god send for her interrupts her panic attacks follows her everywhere can lead her to local shops carry groceries they are on a waitlist to join a service dog program that helps those with disabilitiesbut her condo board filed a court removal of the dog within 24 hours notice else a bailiff will remove the dog ive been trying to help her out with this she has very detailed medical information that this dog is a necessity but that doesnt stop the law the final decision if she can stay with the dog or have to leave will be on the 20thi know something is seriously wrong she is very reserved now i encouraged her to make a facebook post and ig account posting all this info she did but shes given up she doesnt have much family or friend support besides me she has accepted that society will just outcast her she doesnt want to fight another day or have another painful day or puking all day i can tell shes exhaustedive even noticed her dog can tell she stays attached to her hip brings her stuffies when shes sad last few times ive visited her she has stuffies surrounding her you can tell she has sort of gave up on herselfi dont know what to do i cant stop this i cant fight the law we live in a very conservative province and victims are typically overlooked i cant fight her disease the only available treatment slows down the progression of the disease but her benefits dont cover the cost of the medication it costs about 7500 a monthi dont think i can post facebook links here so if anyone is interested in hearingshare her story pm me i can link you maybe if she saw there were other people out there that support her it could helpi just dont know what to do anymore this feels so wrong to me she can barely take care of herself she has no where to go she can move away back to her family but she wont have the medical support there it just bothers me so much knowing that she has months worth of pain pills anti depressants at her place i amfearful on minute shell say fuck it she has done it before except this time her life is much much worse less support bleak future outlookdoes anyone have any advice should i just sell my placei am not very attached to it and find a safer spot

1,i will kill myself if i do not get taller i dont know whyi amposting this seeing asi am not looking to be talked out of anything and if months of therapy counselling and three different types of antidepressant in increasing doses have not done a thing to shift this feeling i doubt reddit will maybe i just want to write it down for the sake of conviction i dont knowim 55 male 19 and never had a growth spurt i cant accept that this is my maximum height the only reason it has not been so great an issue earlier is because i was previously given false hope by doctors that i would grow while being simultaneously being put on sex hormone therapy to accelerate puberty and as result speed up the sealing of my growth platesi refuse to live being shorter than everyone it is something that some people can deal with but i cant i cant go outside anymore because being around taller people makes me physically i will and can induce panic attacks of varying intensity i havent left my house in days and the last times i did go outside i coped only by keeping my head down to avoid looking at anybody and piercing my skin every time i walked past a tall personsome time this weeki am going to meet my gp and ask about being prescribed hgh in hope of alleviating my suicidal thoughts i strongly suspect he will say no as he does not believe i can get any taller and radiologists have already refused an x ray to examine whether my epiphyseal plates are fused i considered purchasing hgh on the black market but i wouldnt know what i was doing concerning dosage and dont know if i would get the safe genuine stuff or some other dangerous drug anyway assuming that i cant get some hgh i plan to commit suicide exactly two weeks from nowthere are of course also other things contributing to my feeling this way but my height is by far the main issue i havent had a genuine conversation in person to anybody outside immediate family and therapists for about two months and all but one of my friends who isnt aware of how i feel and hasnt met me in person in more than a year has not responded to any recent attempt to contact them online i am therefore reasonably certain that while nobody wants me to die i will not be greatly upsetting any of my friends indeed given the fact that we only ever talk online anymore and i havent spoken to most of them in weeks i doubt that they would even be aware of itmy family are of course a different story but the people whose feelings i am most concerned about are my mother who would probably be destroyed and my grandmother who is already unhappy at the moment on account of being i will i am unable to cope with the pain of continuing to live but also unable to cope with the pain of causing them such upset i need advice in this regard i feel conflicted between my firm intentions and what it would do to the people i loveanyway thats the situation i wanted to write it down somewhere thanks for your time if your still here

1,finding it pointless to keep on struggling in life my life up to this point has been miserable for the most part i was born with a speech disorder so i was bullied until about 15 also being on the autism spectrem and having undiagnosed adhd made my existence almost unbearable in addition my mother most likely had borderline personality disorder and my father perhaps had narcissistic personality disorder which caused me to parent myself i was forced to start working at 11 years old to buy food clothing and other necessities i am now 21 years old attending university and am tired of struggling throughout my existence due to being hospitalized during summer and clinically depressed i was unable to save up money for housing this semester now i have to live at my fathers house which is two hours away by two buses and the train from the university so a total of four hours everyday at his house in addition to the neighborhood being located in an unsafe area i have to sleep in the car outside due to a massive bed bug infestationi was homeless while attending university about two years ago and lack the will power to do it again i applied to campus positions that would have granted house but however did not receive any of the positions i am currently working weekends and saving up money until i can move out which would probably three months from now though that feels like a life time i realize that life is unfair however knowing that life is unfair doesnt do anything to mend my soul i realize that i must accept my reality as it is and keep on working towards a better future ultimately however i find it futile to keep on struggling through out my existence especially for an existence that i ultimately lack control of plus knowing in the grand scheme of things that life is utterly meaningless makes me want to end my suffering even more 
1,am15 and i hate myself what a suprise its only the second week of school2nd day and i am already tired i just want to kill myself so i dont gotta go through life and me missing another school year ive missed a couple years due to depression and anxiety but ive never seen professional help for iti amsick of ruining my own life if you were in this position you would understand i cant make friendsi amshy as hell and i amnative american i feel ugly in school i compare myself to people its horrible school is my only problem right now currently lying in bed wheni amsupposed to be in class i am doing this to myself i need motivation to do the most responsible thing i can do right now i just cant you knowi amsupposed to be in grade 10 but i missed grade 9 because of myself i want to go to school and be successful and have a good life but how when all you want to do is end yourself idk if its me or schooli amasking for somebody to i can speak to and some life advice thats all

1,no longer want to live no support system ive pretty much sold everything i own now i have my weapon of choice ready quit my job and putting my letter together cant live with this guilti amhaunted by any longer i need advice because i cant live like this anymore and i just want to end it all no one loves me or cares about me at all and i just need someone to talk to ive started selling my things and getting ready to pick my date i know my post is long but i wanted to give the full picture its been 11 months since i put down my best friend of 16 years my cat i got when i was 9 years old i had a terrible abusive upbringing and he was my only source of support i hate myself for what ive done and ive suffered everyday i cry so hard almost every night to the point that i throw upi feel like i missed the obvious warning signs over his last few months he was keeping to himself and started urinating out of his litter box vomiting often and he got so thin he was a very large cat before and i had put him on a diet so i thought he lost weight from that and i started to feed him more again but he didnt gain any back i took him to the vet to discuss his urinating out of the litter box and vomiting and she told me it was stress and old age and to try a bunch of different stuff that didnt help much changing his food helped a little so i just thought he had a sensitive stomach and neglectedly left it at that i remember being very busy his last month of life because it was october and i was all over the map doing halloween events i had finally made a friend and a was so excited i never wanted to say no to her when she wanted to hang out so i wasnt home much i didnt spend much time cuddling and playing and just plain loving him then i went to a halloween party and stayed at my friends overnight until late that day i got a text from a neighbour saying my cat was meowing a lot and to come home and check on him i brushed it off because he had a tendency to meow loudly when he was looking for me and i was really hungover and wanted to sleep more a few hours later i came home and found him cold and meowing in a tone i had never heard before i picked him up for the first time in a couple weeks and realised how light he had gotten he went limp in my arms and looked so sad he spent his last night and morning all alone and scared because i was out partying and didnt come home i have so much guilt and hatred towards myself for this i rushed him to the animal hospital where they did a bunch of tests and said he had kidney failure they gave me the choice to leave him in hospital until he was stable but then when he went home he would have to undergo fluid injections twice a day take pills and go for dialysis there was no guarantee of this being a cure the other choice was to put him down the vet said he wasnt in any pain so the decision was so hard in the end i realized i wouldnt be able to help him with all his care needs and i didnt want him to be poked with needles all the time and be subject to medications and side effects i now feel so selfish for this because i should have been willing to quit my job and take care of my cat when he needed me to care for him most before the vet came in to euthanize him i got some time to have him in my arms for the last time i couldnt stop crying i was about to murder my most loving and longest best friend i saw the little iv in his arm that they were going to use for the lethal injection and i cried he smelled so bad from the toxins that had built up in his body and he was so cold and wrapped in a blanket he walked away from me to go lay on the other side of the couch he could barely open his eyes and he had exudate coming from them he looked so unhappy i cant believe i wasnt there for him his last night and i left him alone to cry and be scared all morning i fell like the most horrible person on the earth the vet came in and i asked if i could hold him he jumped as she put in the first injection and then she put in the lethal injection and she asked me to lay him down she listened to his heart and i asked her if he was gone and she said yes i sat in the room crying petting his fur watching him just lay there dead because of me and what i just did i covered him with a blanket and left the love of my life alone in that room never to be seen again the amount of guilt and regret i feel every single day is enough to make me not want to go on in this life my actions haunt me everyday and no amount of people saying i did the right thing will ever make me feel like i did the right thing i dont know how to go on and accept what happened and ever be okay with myself i dont know how i can ever forgive myself for not spending everyday of that last month playing with him and picking him up and just loving him i took for granted that he would always be there and i always thought we can cuddle and play tomorrow then i got busy and suddenly tomorrow never came nowi amleft to struggle with the fact that all i have left of him is a album filled with pictures and a ceramic set of paw prints i will cherish these items forever but i am not sure how i will ever be okay again

1,ama waste of a human i like to think that i have the most accurate evaluation of myself wheni amdrunk these days the only way i can feel emotion is wheni amdrunk this is due to my need to supress all emotion normally i know its not a good idea to drink while in this state but i need to keep up normality in front of people by drinking socially i dont want them knowingi amsuicidalanywayi amgenuinely a terrible waste of time i believe that i mean nothing to nobody which i know sounds a bit needy and pathetic which it is this is one of the reasons why i hate myselfi amgenerally a closed person which again i know this is unhelpful and not a good thing to be howeveri am in the belief that if i expose myself i will face rejection and being a burden to people better to keep myself to myselfi really need to die not only am i a faggoti amalso a lonely piece of shit hell the dog doesnt even give a shit i would keep faith if i thought the personality underneath all this self hatred was worth anything turns outi amjust a piece of shit to my core hopefully soon i will be able to brutally mutilate myself drink myself to death or down bleach soon make the world a better place my mother didnt give birth so that my shitty ass could come out

1,veins ive struggled with depression and anxiety the majority of my adolescent life that being saidi amno stranger to the temptations of suicide i attempted suicide once back in highschool but i have always had an issue with selfharm i gave my life to god after my suicide attempt and that seemed to alleviate the pain for a season and i sobered up in reference to cutting for nearly three years afterwards nowi amnearly 21 and almost a divorcee some daysi am fine other days i struggle to get out of bed in the morning the love of my life my best friend of six years who helped me through my depression and brought me to god decided that i wasnt good enough for him anymore he cheated on me god only knows how many times with different people and is now happy in a new relationship i feel likei amstarting the grieving process all over again i was happy with starting anew in acceptance that my marriage was over now i alternate between the stages some daysi am angry and bitter and seek revenge some days i come home from work and just go straight to bed because if one more person asks me ifi amoki amjust going to lose it and some days i prefer these days i get all glammed up and uphold a too hot for you attitude sadly those days are few and far between ive become increasingly aware of how prominent the veins in my arm are they are tiny but the bluepurple tinge provides a nice contrast to my porcelain casper the friendly ghost arms i often fantasize about coming home from a long hard day at work running a nice warm bathtub of water and slitting them open leaving my roommates to find me i know that sounds disturbing and probably selfish but all ive done is act selflessly only to be screwed over and abandoned sometimes the only thing stopping me is knowing that my husky relies on me and that if i died hed be sent to live with my ex where hed be neglected 
1,killed myself in a dream it felt peaceful i killed myself in a dream and after waking up instead of being alarmed or scared i actually felt peaceful been contemplating suicide for awhile now i have ptsd and depression and ive been trying to stay alive through crowdsourcing my my passion just to see if it works out for me and for the people i care for but if it doesnt work out for me i might have to just end it i actually felt depressed when i access it everyday and still nobody appreciates what you do even if its not that huge as long as youre putting your efforts into it i just dont see the purpose of living if youre not doing the thing you love and living with ptsd is really not fun it can haunt you anytime and anywhere and sometimes i dont think i can deal with it anymore where i have to hide myself from everyone else and pretend that youre fine when youre actually not where depression and ptsd is not talked about and people think that youre just overdramatic person ive told my parents about this before and now they act like it didnt happen and sometimes make jokes about the issuei amfacing everytime i feel depressed sometimes i would do something that i know is bad for me like mixing alcohol and other stuff or taking a lot of meds than i should have just sleep off the pain or wheni am too scared i just cry myself to sleep so maybe maybe if i do kill myself would it still be as peaceful and will i feel satisfaction as i did on my dream

1,how i survived this is my story about depression and the struggles post will be long so bare with mehii amredditor 23 years old male i was born to low income family and my brother was handicapped my parents were working 14 hour long days their old company had fallen over and the debt was huge they were starting new company so they could pay the bills and provide us we couldnt afford daycare or anything special and my brother needed to be taken care of so i took care of him since i was 7 years old i rarely saw my parents and they were working most of the weekends as well i didnt have any spare time because the situation of my brother and someone had to take care of the house i did all groceries and house chores including cooking and cleaning walked my brother to the school for disabled kids and picked him up as well just to make it clear my parents didnt ask me to any of this i did this cause no one else could because all the efforts me and my parents made in the next 7 years the firm turned out to be success we had enough money to move to a better place we got new car and all that i got my own pc and everything seemed to turn out welli was 14 when we moved to new town it was a small place with only 8000 people living there first couple weeks went ok untill the older kids started to bully my brother and not like teasing but beating him and telling him awful things like to kill himself and all that i stood besides him and tried to make it stop but it only ended me being bullied as well it was now just me and my brother in the school i fell into deep depression which i still suffer today but ive learned to cope with it i didnt have any real friends and since i actually had some spare times these days i started playing on my pc i found this awesome group of people who i ended up spending all my free time with school was hell but when i was at home it all seemed to go away because i fell in love there was this girl who was playing with us and we started getting closer we ended up talking late to the morning almost everyday eventually i had the balls to te tell her i want to be more than friends and to my surprise she felt the same way only problem was she was living like 150 km 100 miles away from me we used messenger and webcams texting all days and after 10 months we had our first irl date after that date we would travel the distance every weekend to spend time together we ended up doing this for about year untill we didnt want to travel the distance instead we managed to convince our parents that we could move together and we didi had just started high school with my girlfriend and it went pretty well for couple of yearsi am going to skip some details here cause this is turning out longer than i inteded but long story shorti amfalling deeper into depression dreaming about suicide every single day and just trying to act like nothing is going on i start to party and use lots of alcohol and drugs since we had our own place and we partied there 24 times every week with my new friends i end up being alcoholic and drug addict who struggles with schooli am not happy anymore with anything and the acting is taking alot from me i start thinking that i dont deserve this girl and end up leaving her she refuses to leave and i just dont want to hurt her i want to kill myself more than anything i fuck her best friend so she would stop contacting me i wanted her to hate me so she wouldnt mourn after me when i would kill myselfi end up moving with my best friend who i had met during school we take lots of drugs and just hang on after one fucked up trip lsd trip i end up wanting to live more i end up meeting my new girlfriend and the three of us start to hang out we dates for like a year and i end up finding those two cheating behind my back i was very high at the moment when i found out what was going on and end up cutting my wrists just to piss them both of i survived and cut my contacts to minimum with both of them was still living with my friend though i leave for couple of months to travel because i want to kill myself i end up living in my car and after couple of months i find this awesome girl who becomes my best friend we ended up living together well we had sex and acted like a couple without being one hard to explainand after all of this i was 20 so much happens in the next 3 years but this thread is not about me its the story of how someone can survive even against all the odds after all this shit i have been through i hope you manage to pull it through as welli am not saying you might have it better or worse alli amsaying you can do it i did it so will you and my secret to that enjoy and feel triumphant when ever you dont feel like shit because of that small thing i have turned my life aroundedit sorry for all the spelling not my native language and got a little bit emotional writing this down
1,what is the point i have no good friends no job and i drop out of college this year never been in a relationship eitheri amjust always looking a way out of human contact despite this my life is not particularly bad i have home and state supports me enough to live minimal life i could still finish my degree or apply for jobs or at least train my skills as i have all the time in the world but i just dont see why i would want to do that if i can just sit home and do pointless stuff that keeps me somewhat happy and sane this on the other hand has brought up another problem that has been in my mind for months that is why i even continue living when there is no point in anything what does it matter if i die today or live another 60 years accomplishing nothing for the past week i have been thinking just ending it as the void just feels far more better option today i have spent entire day researching different suicide methods so i could just drift awaybut nowi amstarting to feel that being somewhat content with this pointless stuff is actually preventing me from making the final decision and with the constant desire of dyingi amnow in some sort of middle ground where i cant kill myself but i cant live either i just want a way out of this feeling

1,i often find myself wanting to commit suicide over seemingly trivial things can anyone help me i dont know what to do at this point the will to live is getting weaker and weaker and i truly dont want to be on this planet anymore the thing thati am somewhat questioning is that it seems that theres always something minor that seems to set me off and brings me to having these sort of thoughts i sent a really stupid message to this guy thati aminterested in romantically and he hasnt responded due to the message being so fucking stupid and for a few days now i have honestly thought about killing myself and when i look at the reasons why everythings leading back to this message i went through a serious depression in my adolescence and ever since then i feel like my options in life has been severely limited i just dont want to do it anymore and i dont see the point its all just so hopeless 
1,bedbugs fml think i might have just gotten myself evicted for reporting bedbugs exterminator is going to bankrupt me i should just dye the carpet red if i find a notice on my door after that been through too much and if they evict me and my dad i will just whack open my arms and start doing jumpingjacks
1,not wanting to be the boy who cried wolf thats what they all say when i tell themi amhaving suicidal thoughts again oh youve been saying youre depressed for five years now do you ever lighten up youre not actually going to do it you havent done it yetand theyre right i feel like a coward and a liar for being here when i said wouldnt be dozens of times for telling them i was feeling suicidal but not actually following through with my promisespeople should follow through on things you know they should be dependable how would you feel if your friend said he was going to skydive a hundred times and never actually did it i feel guilty becausei amunable to do what i sayi am going to do 
1,i dont even know i wouldnt say i have depression i think i have been sad for a long time but i do believe that if things turned out different my outlook on life would also be different i left high school feeling like i was on top of the world i felt like i was part of a family that would stay with me forever when i started college though everything fell apart i started developing a social anxiety one of the main reasons college sucked was because i started dating this girl who took up all my time she was very clingy and jealous and had depression and anxiety and would never let me go out ever or she would have a panic attack which would lead me to stay everytime i would even mention breaking up with her she would say something about her depression and suicide and it felt like there wasnt much i could do besides stay with her you know i felt trapped and i didnt know what to do for months this would happen and soon led me to being isolated from people on my dorm floor and any types of friends any time she was gone i would just stay in my room because my anxiety made it impossible for me to have the courage to go out and make friends i soon dropped out of college leading to a strained relationship with my parents that hasnt been fixed and finally got the courage to break up with my gf which soon led her to try and kill herself which was the worst day of my life i have always wanted to make people happy and to think that someone wanted to kill themself because of me really took a toll on me i got into some fucked up thoughts i kept thinking if i were not around people would be happier like maybe if i wasnt around my gf would not have tried to kill herself my mom would not be dissapointed in her college drop out son and every single time i messed up especially when i messed up on the job waiting tables i felt like all i did was make people lives worst i started drinking a lot more and started having many suicidal thoughts myself nowi am20 years old who just moved to a new college trying to start over and forget my past but the thing is my past is something that will always be a part of me my anxiety has worsen and i cant help but think that everyone hates me and thinksi ama loser i spend every night in my room watching youtube and will spend days at a time without saying a wordi amjust very unhappy right now and i feel like no one cares about me anymore i dont why i decided to write this and i dont even know if it makes sense but i guess i just need advice from anyone who has gone through something similar i just want my life to go back to normal i dont know if i posted this in the right subreddit but there you go
1,all alone ive thought about killing myself many times in the pat and once tried it but out of fear didnt overdose as much as a fatal dose requires i come from a family wherei amemotionally abused because its the method of parenting known and ive had depression before the last 3 years of my life were the best of my life but my parents forced my boyfriend and i into a situation where it led to him being unable to handle it and he broke up with me i know i have no interest in being with anyone again and my dad has forced me into a career of his choice too theres nothing that gives me hope that the future will be bright ive wanted to leave home for years its almost harder to want death than it is to wish i was never born i dont know what to do anymore and i feel so alone with so many emotions and nothing to look forward too 
1,i shouldve killed my self six years ago when i had the chance i regret not doing it now too
1,this might be it ive been thinking about it for a while nowmaybe this weekend will be it its not like i have a horrble life i have a decent job a caring wife but i just feel extremely unhappy and ive plagued by horrible thoughts of losing all my friends and family for months now they came out of nowhere and its all i seem to think about anymore my childhood was alright aside from the yelling and threats from my dad ive been seeing a therapist and psychologist and have been taking meds but i just feel like i shouldnt be around anymore i have about 50 pills of klonopin some lexapro and a big bottle of whisky maybe hanging myself after taking it all will finish the jobi amscared but idk what else to do
1,i dont wanna die i just wanna get close i dont want to get superpersonal but ive been abused by people i loved in almost every other way besides sexual ive been left by so many people who i loved my dad and the friends i make every 2 years i move a loti amafraid that my only parent will leave me if i come out of the closet shes very religiousbelieves its a choicevoices dislike for a their lifestyle she alsodoesnt believe in depression which i speculate i have havent been diagnosed though my siblings are so distant and care more about their friends than mei think about what would happen if i attempted suicide sometimes and think about how everyone would act i dont actually consider doing it but i think about it mom would actually recognize that who i love doesnt matter my siblings would realize that they werent acknowledging me my dad would hear the news and realize he was a dick everyone would recognize i need love and give me so much of it toowhats wrong with me
1,am going to swall a bottle of ibuprofen by dawn i cant keep living like this all i do is schoolwork my parents are constantly pressuring me and all its done is make my life worse i have nothing to live for i meant swallow in the title by the way

1,i cant go along with this anymorei am in my junior year of high school and i am16 years of age i have never been a good student in school i have something called a slow processing speed which basically means most of the timei ambehind my class the part that really makes me upset is thati am not dumb and i actually have a normal intelligence level but since i have this learning disability i fall behind and get poor grades 81 average to be exact ive gotten special help before but when i do i just get bullied for it and feel even worse i constantly think why cant i just be normal and use my full potential ive been thinking a lot about suicide recently because this is the year that i have the sat and i amdefinitely going to have a hard time and i just feel like if i end it all now my family wont have to watch me fail in life
1,girlfriend showed suicidal thoughts for the first time today hi i need help we kinda had a fight today actually she was just emotionally unstable and she threw this info to me for the first time ever after that i started to think about the hints she gave me and felt stupid because i didnt catch i told her to tell me everything she feels about it from now and that all her fights are mine too she also told me that sometimes she cuts herself in the shower and this has been happening since shes a kid and that the only reason she didnt killed herself yet is because of me ive no idea of what i should do and shes a very smart person so i dont think shes lying at anything because she knows i would find that
1,every time i tell someone my problems they stop talking to me friends internet strangers a freaking therapist gave up on me after i told her some of my problems it just reinforces the idea my problems can never be fixed and i should just kill myself i mean if this many people give up on me why shouldnt i give up on myself
1,does anyone else get worse and start going down the drain when their lives dont feel in their control i cant keep on doing this once the thought of it all being better if i was dead hit i realized how bad it is here for me i am so weak and stupid for letting this all get to me 
1,i just need advice what would you do i posted on first i think it is also suitable here i dont have anyone to talk to about this so i came here i have been feeling really down and depressed lately and it feels like there is no hope another user posted and that is exactly what i am going through and the reason behind my suicidal thoughts the only exception is that my parents are somewhat understanding i was so sure of leaving this world this month so i didnt go back to college this week because i feel too tired mentally plus i wont be here long so whats the point even if i dont kill myself i am not going to school because i feel too anxious and i dont have ability or motivation to study go out or socialize i know i will end up sitting alone not talking to anyone and too anxious to talk to people or make friends i am not going through the anxiety and sadness that comes with going to school for another year i was anxious all through out high school and didnt develop any social skills no friends hobbies so there is interesting nothing in my life to talk about it is not just school even work i feel the same so i quit my part time job too if i just drop out i am going to be a drop out with no social life or a job

1,depression and negative thoughts i dont know if it counts as i dont think about suicide in the way that i imagine most people do but nearly every day i will be doing something simple like driving and just think to myself what if i just drove into that tree or i will think today is the dayi am going to crash and die today and then i safely make it to my destination its pretty much a daily occurrence i often think about how my family will react when they hear news of my body being ejected from my car when it rolled over into a tree if itll make life easier or harder on them i dont know if this actually counts as being suicidal because i dont think i have the willpower to actually take my own life id probably fail at killing my self too but its something thats on my mind daily and i felt like sharing it

1,all my problems can be traced to me being a lazy piece of shiti ama 16 year old in his junior year of high school academically i guess i would be considered at least an above average student the majority of my classes are advance placement this year and my gpa is well above a 40 out of 50i am not sure if it works differently in other states for whatever reason socially i thinki ampretty well liked i have friends and sometimes i even hang around with a few outside of school i have a parent who loves me and an older brother i adore and i live in a household that could comfortable be considered as well offso why do i feel like suicide is such an appealing option for meschool feels like a meaningless stress filled slog at this point although its early in the yeari am already beginning to struggle in a few of my classes i look ahead and my life looks murky and uncertain and i barely have anything planned for college or any inkling that the future will be any less of a meaningless stress filled slog at best i manage to distract myself for a few weeks before falling back into my usual mindseti know that theres a lot of people who are dealing with whati amdealing with or even more theres probably a couple hundred in my school alone in fact i look around and i see people excelling wherei amfailing comfortable wherei amstressed out it makes me wonder wherei am so fucking inadequate compared to the rest that i apparently cant deal with the life problems of a goddamn highschooler ive been doing my best to keep up with the schoolwork spending a few hours every day diligently finishing the homework were assigned but now that harvey has shut down the schools for a couple of weeks i find myself procrastinating the shit out of anything productive i could possibly be doing now that ive been bumped out of the hectic rhythm of school i can barely bring myself to study or practice for anything it pisses off my parents and it bugs me its just the latest example of where my problems wouldnt be there if i wasnt such a lazy piece of shiti amdreading when school starts up again so i have to play the game of desperately try to cover for your own inadequacies when you could avoid all of this by putting in the work in the first place nowi amaware i havent said anything that really sounds suicide worthy if anything i probably sound like a spoiled teen whining over insubstantial bullshit and failing to appreciate how good hes got it honestly thats probably true what makes this even more pathetic is that its not like i feel like my life has hit rock bottom or any of the usual reasons that one might consider killing themselves for or maybei amwrong some people consider killing themselves because their lives are unbearable i guess my reasoning could be considered a really watered down version of that i just really cant see myself going on like thisi dont really know if ive managed to properly convey howi amfeeling or if ive just typed some sort of vaguely depressed ramble the reasons i havent gone through with it yet are 1 i dont want to hurt my family and 2i am too much of a pussy to kill myself in a messy and painful way and the other methods are out of reach from me as a teen really even seriously considering suicide is selfish and probably narrowminded as fuck that doesnt make me feel any better about ittldr whiny teen cant deal with high school and could probably solve all of his problems as well as improve his life in general if hed stop being so fucking lazy

1,hospital didnt even try to help and just left me even more debt ridden i feel likei amout of options if anyone is willing to talk let me know i have too much phone anxiety to call the hotline
1,i wish i was dead or never born since i can remember i have always known that i dont belong one of the first things i can clearly remember was my fathers hate of me his anger that i was even a being his disgusted looks at me made him harm me and witness the evils of a mans capabilitiesi am free of his gaze and feel nothing for him yet since i was 3 i have made many attempts and one of the first thoughts of any given day is that why am i still alive and one of the last thoughts of any given day is i hope i dont wake uppeople around me know of part of my struggles and how i feel but they see me wanting to commit suicide as a selfish act like most people do but to me whats selfish is wanting someone around who is suffering and see no end to that suffering i understand why people commit suicide and i dont think they are selfish we all just want the pain to go away and for some the only way to do so is to commit suicide whats selfish about thati believe that i am here to suffer and endure i am a witness to humanity and ive seen every facet of the evil in a person very rarely i see goodness and kindness and even then i question if its for selfish reasonswe are all selfish beings who want what we want i hate that aspect of myselfmy first attempt was at aged 3 yes 3 you read correctly i set alight my bed as i knew fire purged wrongs from the world as the fire licked at my skin it did not burn and simply was extinguishedanother attempt was around 12 when knowing how to tie knots and the tensile strength of the rope i used i could achieve the goal of ending my suffering a proper tight noose was tied and as i kicked the chair over the beam supporting my weight the rope snapped as though someone swung a sword the strands of rope were cleanly cut yet what i witnessed was an impossibility just as i saw 9 years previousa year or so later at aged 14 i was walking back from school and there was a high walking bridge that went across a dualcarriageway i stopped and knew it was time for me to try once more and so i stood over the railings and let go the reason i am able to write about this today is because my foot was caught in the railing leaving me hanging upside down like in the cartoons when a character is trapped by another managing to get myself up with the aid of another i simply limped home with a somewhat twisted ankle i told the person that a bully had tried to throw me overother attempts have included poisons stepping out in front of vehicles yes this is a bad one but when your in that mindset you dont care i have and never would attempt to jump in front of a train thats just not right having someone clean miles long tracksit would appear that i am here for something as every attempt i make is circumvented somehowthere is a lot i could write or say to my story but i guess i am still searching for a cure to my suffering and pain i am in receipt of medical help and support though i feel that currently there is no new information that i dont already know or could find for myself a long and slow process i am sure at 25 i feel as i always have empty alone and in pain

1,i dont have anything to live for anymore ive been suicidal for a good part of almost ten years now i always just try to push it out of my mind because i have a little sister who looks up to me and would be devastated and for my familys sake id like to share my story because time and time again ive been told everything is my fault and i know its not but it feels like it is my cousin raped me when i was 14i am23 now he stole my innocence from me he stole any goodness or warmth that was in my heart now its just a black hole that explodes every once in a while my family split into three sides the side that blamed me the side that was neutral and didnt care and the side that blamed him which was my parents alone this happened and i tried to kill myself regularly for months taking pills only to wake up in pools of vomit and feces after sleeping for days i spent quite a bit of time in psych wards as a minor and then i found drugs i stopped going to school never graduated dabbled in college a little nothing notable i did drugs instead i did every psychedelic i could find to try to alter my mind and not make me think about my death or taking my own life i also found sex and to this day i have a problem with sex drugs and constant suicidal ideation ive planned my suicide many ways many times i have a box full of suicide notes i fuck random people because it doesnt matter anymore i had a boyfriend for a while who was really good to me but i still have to fuck things up by having random one night hook ups what isnt something that people understand is that sex can be a coping mechanism much like drugs and alcohol i know its something that shouldnt be forgiven and i dont know why i keep doing it ive done it in literally every single relationship ive been in and i dont know how to stop but god i want to stop so badly words cant describe i thought i was with the man i wanted to marry but i cheated on him three times and i still expect him to take me back and love me which is delusional in itself not to mentioni amobviously ridiculously mentally unstable and i ama ticking time bomb constantly my life is a fucking mess and has been consistently a mess for the last 10 years and i dont know what to do anymore every spare moment is spent crying and thinking of the most painless way to commit suicide and which way would be least traumatic for the person who finds me what the fuck can i even do anymore
